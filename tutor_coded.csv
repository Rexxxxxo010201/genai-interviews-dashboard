tutor,AUT-P01,31266,Autumn,tutor,"This tutor is a regular but not intensive user of generative AI, mainly for their own research and communication, and has begun integrating it into teaching through a single structured activity. They are strongly focused on protecting assessment integrity, preferring oral presentations and assignment designs that limit opportunities for unethical AI use rather than relying on student education alone. They perceive student use as mixed, with some creative applications but many superficial or inaccurate uses that harm assessment quality. The tutor feels they lack concrete, discipline-specific guidance and examples, and wants practical, engaging training and ready-made resources from the university.",medium,,,,,,"['assessment integrity', 'assignment redesign to limit unethical AI use', 'student over-reliance', 'superficial AI use and inaccurate outputs', 'need for staff training and practical workshops', 'desire for university-provided examples and resources', 'skepticism about effectiveness of student education alone', 'oral presentations as an authenticity check']",embedded in activities,frequent but superficial,mostly uncritical,plagiarism or originality,mixed
tutor,AUT-P02,31266,Autumn,tutor,"This tutor is highly familiar with generative AI and uses it extensively for their own writing and research, but deliberately avoids using it to design teaching materials or marking, due to concerns about accuracy and trustworthiness. In the subject, they did not formally integrate GenAI, yet they frequently detect its use in student work and are worried about over-reliance, similar outputs, and reduced engagement. They advocate for redesigned, more personalized and oral assessments, explicit AI-use disclosure sections, and tools or processes to trace students’ AI interactions. They also call for systematic guidelines, shared tutor experiences, and formal training for both staff and students on ethical and critical AI use.",high,,,,,,"['student over-reliance', 'assessment integrity', 'need for AI-use disclosure and transparency', 'shift toward oral and process-focused assessment', 'lack of institutional guidelines and training', 'concerns about AI accuracy and trust', 'tutor collaboration and shared resources on GenAI', 'developing students’ critical evaluation of AI outputs']",no integration,frequent but superficial,mixed,over reliance,mixed
tutor,AUT-P03,31266,Autumn,tutor,"This tutor is a reasonably confident everyday user of generative AI who experiments with it in teaching, especially for in-class activities, case studies, and structuring feedback, but avoids using it to generate feedback content directly. They see both positive impacts on engagement and idea generation and negative impacts on assessment integrity, particularly in unmonitored online exams. They strongly emphasize early, explicit communication of rules, ethical expectations, and consequences, and advocate for reflective components where students must explain and critique their AI use. They feel current institutional support is too generic and call for targeted training, clearer subject-level guidelines, and access to paid AI tools so staff can keep pace with students.",medium,,,,,,"['assessment integrity', 'need for explicit AI guidelines and expectations', 'student over-reliance on AI in exams', 'use of AI for engagement and idea generation', 'importance of reflective reporting on AI use', 'insufficient institutional training and resources', 'desire for staff access to paid AI tools', 'designing assessments beyond simple text generation']",embedded in activities,frequent but superficial,mostly uncritical,plagiarism or originality,mixed
tutor,AUT-P04,31266;31269,Autumn;Spring,tutor,"This tutor is generally positive about generative AI, seeing it as an amazing tool for both personal and educational purposes, but insists it should support rather than replace students’ own work. They use GenAI occasionally for teaching ideas, some assessment feedback checks, administration, and research, while remaining cautious about reliability and academic integrity. They observe widespread student use, including clear cases of AI-written text and AI voice-overs, and support institutional moves to embed AI guidance in subject materials. They want more structured training on available tools and consistent expectations across the teaching team to better integrate AI constructively.",high,,,,,,"['assessment integrity', 'student over-reliance', 'cautious use for feedback and ideas', 'need for staff training on AI tools', 'institutional guidelines and disclaimers', 'difficulty detecting AI use at scale', 'positive impact on engagement when scaffolded', 'cross-institutional differences in AI policy enforcement']",limited examples,frequent but superficial,mostly uncritical,plagiarism or originality,mixed
tutor,SPR-P01,31269,Spring,tutor,"This tutor is highly familiar with generative AI from industry and personal use but is cautious about relying on it in teaching, especially for feedback. In 31269 they mainly used GenAI (Copilot) for in-class comparison activities and their own preparation, while insisting students develop their own artifacts and reasoning. They are concerned about student over-reliance, lack of acknowledgment, and limited ethical awareness, and advocate for institution-level AI tools, clearer governance, and practical ethics training.

tutor,SPR-P02,31269,Spring,tutor,"This tutor is moderately familiar with generative AI and uses it frequently in their own work, especially for feedback writing and question generation, but feels under-informed about the explicit purpose of AI integration in the subject. They observed that AI-supported activities increased engagement and improved performance, particularly for already-motivated students, while some students either ignored AI or over-relied on it without proper acknowledgement. Ethical concerns centered on students failing to acknowledge AI use and generating entire reflections with AI, which the tutor addressed by repeatedly emphasizing guidelines and deducting marks.

tutor,SPR-P03,31269,Spring,tutor,"This tutor is a heavy daily user of generative AI (mainly ChatGPT) and feels highly familiar and comfortable using it for teaching preparation, research, and feedback. In the subject, AI was explicitly integrated into tutorial tasks where students had to generate answers with AI and compare them to their own work, which the tutor sees as pedagogically useful but not yet fully engaging. They observe that many students use AI, but only about half critically evaluate outputs, and overall assessment performance has not improved, though understanding of basic concepts and learning approaches seem to benefit. Their main ethical concern is fairness: students who use AI may gain higher marks than those who put in more effort without AI, alongside worries about prompt quality and reliability of AI answers.",high,,,,,,"['high tutor AI literacy and daily professional use', 'AI-supported teaching preparation and feedback', 'prompt quality and sensitivity as a core challenge', 'student engagement and motivation only moderate', 'mixed levels of student critical evaluation', 'fairness concerns about AI users gaining higher marks', 'no clear improvement in assessment performance', 'value of structured AI-comparison tasks for learning']",embedded in activities,frequent but superficial,mixed,equity or access,mixed
tutor,SPR-P04,31269,Spring,tutor,"This tutor is highly knowledgeable about generative AI, both as a researcher in LLMs/RAG and as a teacher who routinely uses GenAI for coding support, content refinement, and to benchmark student work. In 31269 they engaged students in structured activities comparing their own answers with GenAI outputs, but observed widespread over-reliance, prompt manipulation to game tasks, and limited ethical compliance. They see GenAI as powerful and often superior to human-produced content, yet are deeply concerned that many students bypass understanding and reasoning, especially in programming and some group tasks.

tutor,SPR-P05,31269,Spring,tutor,"This tutor has moderate familiarity with generative AI, using tools like Grammarly and Quillbot mainly for writing and occasional tutorial preparation, but not for marking. In the AI-integrated subject, they observe students using Copilot and other tools enthusiastically and frequently, often generating diagrams first and then adapting them. They are concerned that students’ reflections on AI use are very basic and that improved assessment outputs do not necessarily indicate deeper learning, especially without an exam to verify understanding.

They see clear gains in engagement and learning approaches but little improvement in assessment performance, largely due to over-reliance and weak ethical understanding among some students.
