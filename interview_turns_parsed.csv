student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,1,"That is fine. Interviewer: Yep, beautiful. Thank you. AUT-S01. Interviewer: Yeah. Thank you so much for taking part on this quick interview. I really appreciate it. And in regards to the voucher that you will get a separate UTS team will probably contact you during next week. Okay, just to give you this information as well."
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,2,"Yes. Interviewer: Okay, cool. Interviewer: Do you kind of have an understanding what this interview is about."
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,3,"Not really too much other than just like I'm gonna get questions asked about my opinions on generative AI or just AI in general. Interviewer: Yes, that's right. So this whole survey, or those interview questions, and also the research that we are doing currently as part of a teaching and learning grant that Amara got at the beginning of this year. So it's part of the UTS sphere, and there's 2 different subjects that we are piloting in, and you took one of the subjects in the past semester, which is the subject with Subject Coordinator-31266."
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,4,"Yeah. Interviewer: And you also did like an activity in Week 8, if I remember correctly, to use generative AI for this activity."
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,5,"Yeah. Interviewer: Yeah, and we're just trying to see how we could maybe guide students. The best. so the ultimate aim of our research is to see how we can guide students and also teaching staff at UTS in the best possible way in this new environment of generative AI and teaching, studying. And yeah, I just have like a couple of questions. I think in total it's like 10 main questions for you that all relate to some kind of experience with generative AI that you had in the past semester, especially within the subject that you had with Subject Coordinator-31266, if that's cool."
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,6,"Yeah, that's all right. Interviewer: Yeah, then, let's start. 1st question, how did you use generative AI tools? In this subject. So in Subject Coordinator-31266’s subject."
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,7,"So I, I guess…was probably more prevalent, like later on in the subject. But we got introduced to some AI like tools. I guess, specifically some like computer vision…what else was there? I just, I mainly remember computer vision as we got to use some of the tools and for assignment for one of our assignments and explain how it can be used for a specific like industry, we were researching. Interviewer: Yeah."
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,8,"Machine learning at 2. Interviewer: And have you used any other generative AI, like Copilot or ChatGPT for an assignment or class activity?"
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,9,"Like not like directly, however, on some of like the group projects some of my group members did use like ChatGPT, and Copilot, and we use those together to like, for like a class work, or tutorial work. Interviewer: Okay. Have you used Copilot or ChatGPT in other subjects at UTS?"
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,10,"At other subjects. I guess in like a similar way. Where like a group member, ask some generative AI like a quite like some sort of question, and then, based on that, we would go on from there. Interviewer: Do you have any reasons for yourself, why, you haven't used generative AI, tools frequently?"
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,11,"For myself, it's I feel like it's mostly just like a personal thing. Like, I guess, like I don't think to use Generate AI as 1st before anything else. I guess I can. If I was like researching something I would 1st like go to like Google or something. And just like, ask questions there. Interviewer: I'm going to put a couple of answers in the chat real quick and maybe you can have a look at those and tell me which one is, maybe one of the reasons for you why you haven't really used generative AI tools that much."
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,12,"It's probably like the preference to traditional learning, and like some ethical concerns and also like the accuracy and reliability. But that's less so nowadays. But it was..it's mainly preference for traditional learning methods. Interviewer: Okay. Was there anything that could have encouraged you or supported you to try them, or to use them more frequently?"
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,13,"I get like I'm not sure exactly, but I feel like, I guess just knowing like more specific details about, I guess what it is. Cause I can get like on like the surface level, like. Oh, it does this and this, but like underneath that, I don't really know how that's being done and I feel like, do I trust it? I don't know if, like that is, and like I feel like, if I were like say go with it, there's also like problems of like…do what should I fact-checked it? Or like something, for, like AI, or like generative AI, like giving me some sort of output. Interviewer: Okay, for the examples that you have given where you use generative AI for completing assessments like in group work, did you find it helpful to use it in those moments?"
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,14,"It definitely made it way faster. That's for sure. Like some of like the work. I felt like I did like I did like a little bit. But a lot of the rest of the time was like, actually, I don't remember what this like. I could focus pretty well on one question, just like myself. But for, like the group work where there was like multiple questions, it was definitely way faster to, I guess, give it to AI, and then synthesize it after that. Interviewer: Those examples for group work, was it mainly because your other group members they didn't contribute as much? And you try to catch up for their work or?"
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,15,"No, though I'd say, my, my groups have been pretty like we're contributing pretty well, and like other stuff. I just thought various questions, it's very easy to just put it into like a generative AI, and then get an output that's pretty clear. Interviewer: Do you still remember what kind of assessments this were, like those group assessments? Was it like creating infographics or pivot table exercises? Reflection.."
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,16,"For I guess specifically in the intro to information systems? It was mostly tutorial work where we would like given like some question that I guess we could like that will like mentor research by like, I guess putting it to AI. It gave us a pretty like pretty like good scaffold, for like what an answer should be! And if we ever needed any more information, we just like look up like specific parts of that answer. Interviewer: So you would say it was pretty handy for gaining like an overview of a topic first, before you dive deeper into it."
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,17,"Yeah, it definitely made it just easier to just look at the larger surface of the topic before diving deeper. Interviewer: Maybe also in terms of like time efficiency?"
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,18,"Yeah, that, too. Cause…I guess researching would have taken time to cover that surface to like find it. Interviewer: Okay, nice. How did your confidence in using AI tools for learning change throughout the semester?"
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,19,"Yes, I myself I don't particularly like it, cause whenever I like read I guess like something from it, like whenever I was, it was like put into like our work, our group work. I'll I didn't like always understand it, or like I still had like…this is still fairly general, and I wanna like go a little bit more deeper into it and so….I guess it's just… I got the output, but I didn't really like quickly learn it. And so I had to like, still do the, I guess old fashioned researching and whatnot to like actually understand it. Interviewer: Interesting. Maybe the next question is connecting quite nicely to what you just said, how easy or difficult was it to critically assess the quality and accuracy of AI generated content in those moments? You were saying you didn't always agree with, or you didn't understand straight away the output. So, how easy or difficult is it for you, or was it for you to critically assess the quality and the accuracy?"
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,20,"I think Copilot and such they like give you like a source that like they got it like they got the information from, and that made it easier to like, understand, like, okay, so this is what it means by that. And like does that relate to what we're doing or like what the answer was? But like, at 1st glance, I guess, I always saw it with like some scepticism like, no matter what. Because I guess I didn't really understood like where it would come from. Interviewer: If I understood correctly from your personality type…there weren't really situations where you trusted generative AI too, much you were like rather the opposite you, you didn't really believe in what it was mentioning, even though there's like sources, provided you were still like kind of very critical when going through the output, right?"
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,21,Yes. Interviewer: Sceptical you were saying?
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,22,Yes. Interviewer: Okay. Did you use any strategies to verify the reliability of AI generated content or responses.
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,23,"Like, I'm not sure if you…I guess like, I guess, just like specific like, if I knew, like a general like topic that it was on. I guess. Say, it was like on like… or, it was like answering questions about like ethical issues in industry. I guess I could like… I would sometimes like double check that with other sources that I read myself. And like, you know how sometimes it like produces a list of things… I guess understand what that meant first, trying and like look, I guess, see if there's any other sources there that wasn't given, and then I guess that's how I would double check it. I would also, like, you know, double check the source that I'm checking it from, like, you know, with the classic methods. Interviewer: Yeah. So you were even going into some of the sources to see if they really exist and if they're really stating what has been mentioned."
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,24,"Yeah. Interviewer: Okay, nice. Were there moments where you realized AI generated content was incorrect or misleading. And how did you handle that? I think you mentioned already some of it."
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,25,"Yeah, whenever it wasn't really like, I guess, what I what I thought would be correct. If it's like something simple, I would usually just like not use that, just like that specific part and then focus on the other stuff that I can like verify. If it's something, I guess something that like is kind of important, I’d like at least like use it as like a starting point. Just to like, look up other stuff. Otherwise it's… I don't know, I guess, replacing the parts that were wrong. And yeah, just like, mostly just replacing the parts that are wrong, and removing the ones that I can't replace. Interviewer: Okay, next question, did the subject with Subject Coordinator-31266 help you feel more prepared to make ethical decisions when using generative AI in academic or professional settings?"
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,26,"Do you think you can repeat that one. Interviewer: Did the subject, I can also…maybe it's easier if I just copy and paste the question at the same time into the chat. So did the subject help you feel more prepared to make ethical decisions when using generative AI in academic or professional settings?"
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,27,"Somewhat, I guess, I already knew that I like I shouldn't be relying on it like heavily and that seemed to be echoed within what I like learnt in my subjects. And I guess the main thing is to show me like specific cases of like where you might want to rely on it, or where it's like only somewhat reliable, and I guess, making like…it's up to like me to make my own decisions on what it is. It didn't really give me specific/super specific guidelines on when using generative AI. Interviewer: So you didn't really felt guided in this subject if I understood it correctly, in terms of making ethical decisions when using generative AI. It was more your general knowledge that you gained so far at university, and your own way of making those decisions with your previous knowledge, right?"
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,28,"Kind of. It is still, the subjects themselves still like revealed I guess avenues that I didn't consider, and that helped guide like what do I think is okay. Interviewer: Do you have an example, maybe for that?"
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,29,"So this wasn't specifically in introduction to information systems, but another subject called Communications for it Professionals…and during the tutorials sometimes they'd show like a case study, or like a news article of like of a AI tool being like either wrong or used incorrectly for scenario and seeing the impacts of it. Interviewer: And this helped you like in terms of guidance?"
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,30,"This helped me like, one know what the consequence like consequences are where people may use it. And I guess what ways we can avoid completely relying on AI. Interviewer: Okay, next question, about the UTS policies in terms of academic use of generative AI. Do you find it difficult to understand your institution's policies on the ethical use of generative AI in assessments?"
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,31,"I don't think so. Like my tutors are pretty like pretty thorough in saying that you may specifically use Microsoft Copilot in like helping your assessments and like, if you happen, if you happen to use its output, then it still needs to be credited, or said that you've used the AI tool. However, the other, I guess other tools aren't allowed unless told so. Interviewer: So you have never really felt unsure about whether you use generative AI or your use of generative AI was within policies…"
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,32,"I don't think there are many cases where I was… if there was, I'd usually ask directly my tutor, and they would give me an answer pretty quickly and so I wasn't lost for very long. Interviewer: Okay, nice. In Subject Coordinator-31266’s subject do you remember if there were the policies clearly explained, or subject materials offered on Canvas? Interviewer: I think you're muted."
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,33,"Oh, sorry! Mind if you repeat that question? Interviewer: Yeah. So the policies were they clearly explained in your classes, for example, in Subject Coordinator-31266’s subject, or within the subject materials of this class on canvas?"
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,34,"I felt like I'd, I felt like I learned it more in a different subject, mostly because I had it first. But yeah, I even intro to information systems with Subject Coordinator-31266, there was some examples of explicit saying of like, where you're allowed to use. AI, but it's mostly in reference to just like if you're unsure ask your tutor or look it up. Interviewer: Okay, next question, do you feel like there could be any extra support being offered in terms of using generative AI that you would like to see being offered from university? Maybe workshops, drop-in sessions, tutorials, or in class discussions.."
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,35,"I'd feel like mainly just…it doesn't have to be like a like a whole session for it, but like just easily referenceable, like material of like, okay, where is where's the line between what's okay and what's not okay. Cause currently, whenever I'm like thinking, like, is this okay, okay to use? I kind of have to like, guess where the line is sometimes. I guess for an example, in another subject, there was a research task, a group research task, and my team members use like AI in some of their parts and like, I guess, changed it around a little and I wasn't too sure if that was okay or not. And so I would like to know, like, without needing to like directly. ask somebody about it like, Is this like copying or like plagiarism, cause like the regular plagiarism guidelines doesn't really explicitly say, like, if that's okay. And I would just like to know more about that. Interviewer: Okay, nice. Last question. If generative AI tools continue to be integrated into coursework, like, you have seen it in Subject Coordinator-31266’s subject for one of the tutorials, how do you think they should be used? So what role should generative AI play in assessment, more as a tutor, collaborator, or something else. Do you have anything in mind?"
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,36,"I guess I feel like specifically like generative AI, for like text that like you ask it a question, and it gives like answers you back as accurately as possible. I feel like that should be decently limited, and I think that comes from like, I guess this other subject again…occasionally we get like given work for this group research task and I give them like a question like, can you research about this topic and that they would like immediately put it to ChatGPT or something like that and give that back. And whenever I need a like ask them to like present that information then, they were not super thorough about it. And I would like for them to know, know the sources which I think like the Copilot does. But I guess mainly I would like to keep it more like the background, because I guess it's pretty easy to just like get out an answer and not understand it. Interviewer: Okay, great. Thank you. AUT-S01, this was already the last question, if you have another 10 min, I would just go real quickly with you through a potential student resource for generative AI. If you have the time."
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,37,"Yeah, I think I got time. Interviewer: Yep, cool. Let me just share my screen in a second. Give me a second. […] Interviewer: Alright, AUT-S01. Then have a great evening and see you around."
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,38,"Have a great evening too. Interviewer: Yup, thank you. Bye-bye."
student,31266,Autumn,First,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,39,Bye.
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S01,AUT-S01,1,Interviewer: Is it okay for you if I record this session for data analysis purpose?
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,2,"Yep, 100%. Interviewer: Yeah, nice, beautiful. Do you hear me clearly?"
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,3,Yep. Interviewer: Nice I think you already have an idea what the interview is about. Right?
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,4,"Yeah, like AI within sort of the engineering and IT sector. Interviewer: That's right. So it was part of a FFYE research grant what we're working on right now, and the subject that you took with Moretza this semester. The introduction subject is the 1st pilot subject for our research. And today's interview session is mostly about generative AI, and how you utilized it, and what was good, what was bad about utilizing it kind of, I have prepared multiple questions for you and if you want, we can just start straight away."
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,5,"Beautiful, happy, to. Interviewer: Cool. Interviewer: So the 1st question is, how did you use generative AI tools in this subject in Subject Coordinator-31266’s subject?"
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,6,"Mostly questions and queries for sort of to get a base understanding for an example for an assignment so like our last assignment, was to create a pivot table off a Excel spreadsheet, and instead of going back into my workbook and looking all that would just ask AI, maybe like, what are the steps to create a pivot table in the Excel spreadsheet, and then follow that to sort of help me with my assessment a bit. I'd also use it for like recommendations. So for any report we had to write, I would use it to fact-check and all that sort of thing, double check on my citations, make sure my citations were written correctly. I didn't use it as much to find information. I find research pretty easy, like I understand how to do it well, but more putting stuff together. So I found sometimes I mix myself up about like where the best part to put a paragraph or something is so I'd ask it like, Oh, does this bit? Is this conducive to put after this? Or would it make more sense to, you know, mix it around that sort of thing. Interviewer: Nice, okay second question, did you find generative AI helpful in completing assignments? Why or why not?"
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,7,"Yes, I did it. It provided, well, because you can ask it to reframe things and rework explanations rather than you know, asking person to person communication can get model asking it direct, like giving a direct and definitive answer in multiple different ways, is what I found the most helpful. Interviewer: Was there anything it wasn't really helpful for?"
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,8,"Yeah. This isn't like so much as physical but I felt slightly cheating using it. Obviously, it is like, kind of a gateway into other things, but it wasn't useful in actually helping my with my learning. I'd say so. I'm not taking in as much because I'm not putting in, you know the extra 3 hours instead of the 3 min that it takes me to type in a chat question. Interviewer: Okay, fair enough. You mentioned already in terms of assessments, you used it for pivot table exercises, did I understood this correctly, yeah? Did you use it for anything else like for quizzes or video making activity, infographics, reflections, reports…"
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,9,"Infographics definitely not. I know. We made that one in class quizzes possibly a question here or there, if I was unsure, but they were pretty like easy for this subject. Reflections and written assignments like, I said, more sort of content, based rather than research, based and structure based. I forgot what other assessments we had. I think that was it. Oh, group assignments, presentations. We did use it for presentations. We used it for the design of presentations. Interviewer: Was it helpful for that?"
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,10,"100%. It really cut out a lot of the time sake. And you know, wasting time on, what should the presentation look like? So I asked AI. I think I said, what's like the most effective colors, pictures, or shapes to use for this topic and subject, and it gave me that. And then we created off that. Interviewer: Okay, nice. How did your confidence in using AI tools for learning change throughout the semester?"
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,11,"Good and bad depends on what AI we're talking about. I would say so. The ones that I would personally use say, for example, either Siri ChatGPT, or like the inbuilt ones, like the very mainstream sort of ones, became quite easy, because they're so accessible. That's what I would sort of revert to. But the ones that I wasn't so confident about was the ones we actually learned about in class. So the teachable machines all that sort of thing, because yes, we learned about them and had an example in class but that was kind of it. It wasn't really further extended into like a business model or situation where we would use it in the real world it was kind of like, oh, here's what you have. Now you go create an idea, and if you want to use it more, you use it more kind of thing. I'd love to like it be extended a little bit more about what applications they all have that we learned about. Interviewer: Okay, nice. Thank you. How easy or difficult was it to critically, assess the quality and accuracy of AI generated content for you?"
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,12,"For me. I find it relatively easy. I wouldn't say it was taking one look, and then being able to decipher it, but it was pretty easy if you understand writing. And like, I'm a sort of that education level of understanding what good writing looks like and what it doesn't look like, and also just knowing like a written pattern behavior. So obviously, you can see a perfectly written essay that is written by AI, or perfectly written essay that's written by humans kind of very different grammar and structure. So just knowing the difference is really helpful in making sure you're not getting caught out. And that sort of thing. Interviewer: But yeah, but maybe more in terms of like the output itdelivered, not regarding the way it was kind of writing the output, but more in terms of the output. Was it easy for you to critically assess the quality."
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,13,"Ahh okay if it gave me an answer if I can understand it? Interviewer: No, not if you can understand it. But did you just accept whatever generative AI was telling you? Or did you also critically assess, if that's actually the right answer or not."
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,14,"Right. Yes and no again. So I would definitely fact-check and look back for everything that was sort of the more important assignments. So anything that was like the pivot table, I would double fact check. So I'd go, and I'd try. It's like step-by-step instruction on how to make a pivot table all that sort of stuff. I'd go back and check that. But if it was something small like the quiz answer for something or something like that. I don't know something small and sort of menial. I wouldn't really fact check it, as I sort of just check my own knowledge mentally and go oh, does that sound about right? And then make a judge based off common sense. Interviewer: So you don't really have any specific indicators that help you to judge the quality of accuracy, it's more your own understanding, that you're using, did I understood that correctly?"
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,15,"Yeah, I'd use, like my own intuition, sort of as the main base. Now that you said all that doesn't sound too good. Interviewer: This leads me to the next question. Do you think there are situations where you may be trusted Generative AI too much?"
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,16,"Yeah, I think it's definitely sort of a bit of a trap you can fall into easily. I think, like it comes down case by case in my opinion. If you're learning the work in class and you understand it well, and then use AI on top of that, it'll be fine. But if you're using it instead of learning, that's when it becomes the issue. Interviewer: Okay next question, similar context, slightly different. What strategies did you use to verify the reliability of AI generated responses? Maybe not only in this subject, maybe also in other subjects. You were talking about pivot tables already a bit, but maybe you have any other strategies to verify the reliability."
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,17,"Yeah, okay, I think I would. Oh, what did I do? Trying to think back. Oh, mainly just sort of inputting other forms of information, so maybe doing my own research first, then popping into chat and going add on to this, and then it already has a base to sort of start with like, and it's kind of pre verified in a way, because it has like, oh, you want this sort of information. I'll get that as well. But I would go back and check like canvas learning for example. I'd go back into Canvas and be like, oh, does that sound right? Is this learning correct? Yeah, kind of just going back to my own information research 1st and building off that. Interviewer: So basically consulting other sources as well."
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,18,"Yes, 100%. Interviewer: Do you maybe a rough estimate how much time you would generally spend for more important assignments to do that, to verify the content."
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,19,"Probably I'd say about 3 hours, basing that off 2 assignments that come to mind. Yes, about 3 hours. Interviewer: Were there moments where you realized AI generated content was incorrect or misleading and how did you handle those moments?"
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,20,"Yes, I did. This was mainly within one of my coding classes. It would provide me an output, but obviously a very simple, or it would provide an output that wasn't completely correct in the language that we were learning. So then I would test it and take the code, and it would come up with errors. And so then I was like, oh, I can't rely quite heavily on this to provide examples. So that was when I would go back and sort of check it and use my own knowledge and the knowledge on canvas to get some sort of correct answer. Interviewer: Okay, did the subject, so Subject Coordinator-31266’s subject help you to feel more prepared to make ethical decisions, when using generative AI in academic or professional settings?"
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,21,"Yes, to a degree, I'd say, sort of like middle ground on that. It didn't impact me heavily but definitely more consideration taken now. Interviewer: Do you have maybe an example of how?"
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,22,I'm not too sure I might come back to that one. Interviewer: Do you find it difficult to understand your institution's policies on the ethical use of generative AI and assessments?
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,23,"No, not at all very simple, very straightforward and they repeat it pretty much at every class. Interviewer: So it's present in every single class, the same guidelines?"
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,24,Pretty much yep. Interviewer: And the policies were also clearly explained in your classes or subject materials on canvas all the time?
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,25,"Not all the time, there was some things I would learn like one thing in one class and one thing in another, so it wasn't fully across the board, but like it was 85% across the board, pretty well repeated in every class. Interviewer: So you have never felt unsure about whether you use Gen AI within the policies or not?"
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,26,"No, not really. Interviewer: What support do you need to use Generative AI, even more appropriately?"
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,27,"I would say…more understanding on the benefits and negatives of it. So yeah, you can understand, like the ethical use, it's not your own work and all that sort of thing. But how..I don't know…it's it's a hard sort of…it's not a definite yes or no. It's just kind of like a…I don't know. It's how to how to use it effectively without getting in trouble for is what I'd say. So don't create your entire assignment with it, but do use it to, you know, help you get better marks. Interviewer: So do you think it could be maybe a good idea to have some extra workshops that kind of prepare you on how to make the most out of Generative AI?"
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,28,"Yeah, I wouldn't even say workshops, though, because I know a lot of workshops that you need go like on not taken by students because of the lack of like information around them. Like, literally in class, I would love to learn about a teacher saying, don't use, you know, ChatGPT to create your reflection for this assignment, use this other platform that, you know might help you write better, or use different ideas, that sort of thing. Interviewer: That's interesting. So you mean having a tutor in class that really, based on your weekly activities, shows you how to maybe utilize generative AI in a way that it helps you, and that it's still like within the policies of UTS."
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,29,"100%. Absolutely, I think flat out use of AI obviously makes a degree somewhat redundant. There's no point having it. If you're just going to take information from elsewhere. You can learn by yourself all that sort of thing. But if you're in class and you're learning, say, this is AI, it's going to help you learn even more. You know what I mean. You're going to take the AI and let it assist you to understand something else rather than getting it to understand for you. Interviewer: Nice. Have you ever hesitated to ask for help using generative AI in class?"
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,30,"Yeah, I'd say a little bit back to what I said about learning more situations and sort of business environments where we would use the different AI machines. So what did we use? My brain's gone… It was a teachable machine. It was, Miro something else. All the different platforms that you might only use once you're within a business kind of thing, and we're only just sort of touching the subject of them. I'm not sure if I'm going to learn them more in other subjects, because it is only the introduction class. But yeah, I don't know just a little bit more business related or business sense detail about each one how to use them. Maybe a business situation where, like it was a group assignment, you're in a situation where you need to use Miro for something. Go and create a profile and use it. Interviewer: But have you maybe even hesitated to ask for help? How to use generative AI for your assessments or for your activities in class?"
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,31,"No, I would say definitely, not between the list of policies being so easy to access, and it being very simple to use between those 2 things. I don't think I've ever really had a doubt about how to use it, or when to use it. Interviewer: Okay, next, and already last question, if generative AI tools continue to be integrated into coursework, how do you think they should be used?"
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,32,"I think that goes back a little bit to my having like subjects, or I guess assignment specific AI uses. So in class, there is this AI piece that can help you with this… I mean grammarly, technically, yes, because it is like AI. If we use that for an example, it'll help you write better. It'll give you suggestions, all that sort of thing. But you still have to do the writing yourself first. Something like that. Interviewer: Are there any risks or concerns that you see?"
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,33,"100%, going back to creating sort of an invalid reason to go to university or education in general, I think, AI is so good that it's bad, in my opinion. I know that sort of strong stance to take, but it does so much for us that we no longer have to do a lot for ourselves. So it's more about using it in a way that benefits us and not relying on it. That's what I'd say. Interviewer: Okay, great, nice. Thank you so much for answering all those questions. So one more thing. Do you think you still have? Maybe 10 min. […]"
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,34,Awesome. Thank you so much. Really. Great. Interviewer: Thank you.
student,31266,Autumn,Second,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,35,"Yeah, bye-bye. Interviewer: Have a great day bye, bye."
student,31269,Spring,First,student,AUT-S02,AUT-S02,1,"Interviewer: Just turn on the recording. I hope it's okay that I will do a voice recording of this session for data analysis purposes, but all your name will be anonymized, your name won't appear anywhere, it's just basically the data that we collect for some of the questions that we have prepared. That's all good with you?"
student,31269,Spring,First,student,SPR-S01,SPR-S01,2,"Yeah, no worries, that's awesome. Interviewer: Amazing. Alright, maybe just as a quick introduction, so you took the subject 31269, business requirements modelling, right?"
student,31269,Spring,First,student,SPR-S01,SPR-S01,3,"Yes. Interviewer: And, this subject, did this semester something different, and what was different is it, integrated AI into its curriculum in certain activities and also assignments, as you know by now. And, this research that we're conducting right now is part of the FFYE grant. It's, the first and further year experience grants from UTS, focusing on BIS subjects, for first-year students, and the study aim is to better understand how students engage with AI-integrated assessments, and how students develop evaluative judgment skills for learning and reflecting with those tools. And I've prepared a couple of questions. I will pop those questions into the chat, so you can also follow them in the chat. And, yeah, that's basically the scope of this interview."
student,31269,Spring,First,student,SPR-S01,SPR-S01,4,"Easy, awesome. Interviewer: Amazing. Then let's just start straight away. First question, I'm just copy and pasting the first question. The first question is, how did you use generative AI tools? For example, Copilot, ChatGPT, in the subject, 31269. Maybe you can just walk me through a specific example of how you used one of those tools, for an assignment or class activity."
student,31269,Spring,First,student,SPR-S01,SPR-S01,5,"Yeah, no worries. So, when it came to the class activities. A lot of them actually recommended us to use AI, and it was more used in this comparative framework, where it's, we'll use AI to do one portion of a task, and then we need to do it ourselves, and then we can compare for accuracies, inconsistencies, similarities, and differences. And I personally re… I thought that was great, because knowing, like, students and knowing myself with the power that AI has, it's going to be used no matter what. However, its effectiveness when being used, that is still very, very inconsistent. Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's not. I've noticed that generative AI is not very good at critically analyzing. If I'm to go back to when I did the HSC, anything that requires, like, strong critical thinking skills, AI is very weak at doing. But it's great at doing what I would call ground work, things that can be done… almost like just background information. So, another example that comes to mind is with the…with the case study that we were provided, it was great using AI almost as, like, a… a investigative journal, where it was… we could copy and paste the case study inside of, let's say, ChatGPT or Copilot, and then you can ask ChatGPT or Copilot to find certain things within it. That way, we're not doing that ground work, as I said, but we're letting AI doing it. We're kind of trying to streamline the process. So that was something that me, but also, like, my entire group used, and that's what allowed us to be a bit quicker when it came to getting classwork done. And that was similar with assignments, being able to implement, you know, submitting the assessment notification within ChatGPT or Copilot, and then asking, like, what is an appropriate distribution of this work? That way, everyone's doing their equal part, things like that. So, being able to… I think AI, using it for BRM, it was most effective when basically making it do all the ground work. Interviewer: Amazing answer, SPR-S01. Thank you so much for so much information. Really great. And maybe now looking also in your personal space, how often do you use generative AI tools, and for what purposes?"
student,31269,Spring,First,student,SPR-S01,SPR-S01,6,"Yeah, no worries. I use it quite a bit. I have a ChatGPT Premium account with 3 of my other friends, and we just, you know, share the costs. But we all use it for our uni and personal lives, so I like to keep myself very busy. I worked… I used to work 3 jobs, now I'm working 2, but I would often use it when it comes to creating timetables. I use it for, like, how I want to allocate myself for going to the gym, and maybe what kind of splits I want to use. And then when I was… I played a lot of sports, so I've got a volleyball shirt on currently, so I would also do it in regards to, like, tracking myself and seeing, like, okay, what's a skill that I've been improving on? Orone that I want to improve on, and what are exercises that I can do to maybe increase my vertical jump, or increase the speed of my arm swing? Things like that. So, within my personal life as well, I try to incorporate it a lot, even… I'm just trying to think what I've used it most recently for. Things like, are trying to… I've… so, I'm Christian myself, so being able to use it almost as, like, a referencing tool, or trying to get it to supplement my own understanding, or perhaps break down complex concepts, or provide a historical context. So, you know, if I'm reading the Bible, if I don't know what's happening, being able to ask AI or go into Google and find out the historical context at the time. Maybe why there was different cultural or social values. So I try to use it as a way to better educate myself in everything, and streamline every single, I guess, facet of my life. Interviewer: Amazing. I love your excitement around the tool, it's really great to see. It's… it makes this whole interview more exciting for me as well, so thank you for sharing, nice. Let's jump maybe back to university and assessments. Next question that I will pop into the chat window…Did you find generative AI helpful in completing assessments? Why or why not? You were already mentioning for ground work, it's great, but maybe you can give some more specific examples for good use cases, and use cases that might be not really good for…"
student,31269,Spring,First,student,SPR-S01,SPR-S01,7,Absolutely.
student,31269,Spring,First,student,SPR-S01,SPR-S01,8,"Absolutely. So, I'm studying a Bachelor of Cybersecurity in Criminology, so those are two very different degrees. So I've noticed that AI has been helpful in both, but they've been helpful in different ways. So, for my Criminology assessments, majority of them are reports, comparative analysis, and essays. Now, as I mentioned before, generative AI is terrible at critical thinking, and majority of essays and reports require a stronger amount of critical thinking. That's where you show your intelligence as a student. So, in that instance, AI is quite bad. I would never use it. I don't use it. What I do get it to do, though, is almost synthesize the marking criteria. So, one of my favorite things, or one of the things that I will use, is I'll submit the assessment criteria into, let's say, ChatGPT, and then I can say, give me dot points on key points and figures that I need to talk about to achieve a HD mark. So, in that instance, AI becomes very powerful. Because then, again, rather than me having to go through the marking criteria myself, and obviously I'll still fact-check it, because, you know, AI has its hallucinations, but it is very helpful in being able to get me into the writing process far quicker. So, that is where generative AI has been very helpful in completing my assessments. Do I use it to actually create my essay itself? No. I see it as definitely far weaker than me. I know that I can communicate to a higher degree and reach, you know, HD or distinction mark in a more reliable and accurate way than AI, and also because I don't want to be disingenuous. I want it to be my work and not the work of, you know, an algorithm. So, from what I've said, like, it's helpful in some aspects and not in others. And then when it comes to cybersecurity, I've had a mix of everything. I've had practical labs, I've had reports, I've had presentations. So I have used it in my generative AI. Sorry, I have used it in some of my assessments. So I know I had a report. Once I'd finished completing that report, I actually just put… pasted the whole report into AI and said create a PowerPoint presentation, because that's part of the ground work. The thing that I needed to prepare was, you know, a script, or, what is it? How I… my actual talking skills themselves, you know, slowing down my speech, speaking loudly, eye contact. But the actual creation of the PowerPoint was… is ground work, in my opinion. So I just pasted it into AI, yeah, pasted my script into AI, got it to make a PowerPoint with the notes, with the script embedded, and then from there, I could just record the rest. So, that's kind of how I would view it as helpful sometimes, and then not helpful in other times. Interviewer: Amazing. Thank you, SPR-S01. Next question, and I feel like this question, your answer, you can keep quite brief, How did your confidence in using AI tools for learning change throughout the semester? Considering that you have quite a high expertise in using generative AI tools, was there any change for you?"
student,31269,Spring,First,student,SPR-S01,SPR-S01,9,"I think there was, especially with BRM, because it was actually recommended that we use AI, so you got to look at it and, you know, provided different prompts and questions. But I think my confidence overall has stayed quite the same. I know… I feel like I have a good grasp of its strengths and weaknesses, especially in relation to my two degrees, so I know how I'd use it, and where I'd use it, and where I wouldn't use it. So, I'd say my confidence using AI tools was around the same, although I did, I guess, get to improve my skills. Interviewer: Thank you for sharing, SPR-S01. Next question. How easy or difficult was it, or is it for you to critically assess the quality and accuracy of AI-generated content?"
student,31269,Spring,First,student,SPR-S01,SPR-S01,10,"Hmm, that's a really good question. I feel like it is quite easy for me, because, as I said, if it's the ground work, or at least for me, because I'm not using AI, to make my essays, or to make my large, you know, large portfolio of…essays, reports, exams. When it's the ground work, it's very easy to do a quick, not even get… a quick guess and check, basically, of, okay, this is the HD criteria, does this make sense? Do I need to reference this thing 3 times, or 4 times? You know, APA seven referencing. So I found it very easy to critically analyze, or assess the quality and accuracy. Every now and then, it will miss things, that's something I notice, or it will, again, make up things, the whole data hallucination. So being able to catch those are important. However, because I'm asking it to just give me dot points, oftentimes, if it's just making up something, it just means that I'm writing more than I need to. So I wouldn't lose marks, per se, but I would just be, like, I'd just be inefficient. So, I guess that's how… what I would say. Interviewer: Great. Thank you for sharing. So basically, a lot of cross-referencing that you do, for parts of it, and then on the other hand, you don't really rely too much on it, which means you're not really in that situation, where you maybe trust generative AI too much."
student,31269,Spring,First,student,SPR-S01,SPR-S01,11,"Yep. Interviewer: The next question we also answered, actually, just now, is the same again. What strategies did you use to verify the reliability of AI-generated responses? Anything else that you want to add, except of cross-referencing?"
student,31269,Spring,First,student,SPR-S01,SPR-S01,12,"Yeah, not particularly. I think if you know what you're inputting into whatever AI frame, like, AI you're using, then it should be quite simple to cross-reference it and ensure the validity and reliability of it. I think the problem is when you're asking to generate its own opinion, or generate its own information. That's when the data hallucinations can be a lot more, a lot more vast and varied. So, again, when just putting it to a read the assessment criteria, it's… it's quite simple to… to verify, just through cross-referencing. Interviewer: I feel like also the next question we answered… yeah, the connection is breaking up a tiny bit, I feel like, but the voice is still fine, just the video sometimes gets lost. The next question, again, looking at some of the flaws, were there moments where you realized AI-generated content was incorrect or misleading? How did you handle that? So, you were already mentioning hallucinations."
student,31269,Spring,First,student,SPR-S01,SPR-S01,13,"Yeah, so once I had, I guess, uncovered the hallucination, or where it said basically the wrong thing, I kind of called it out, and then it would try and change it, but oftentimes, it might take multiple attempts, so it's making sure, like, hey, you don't actually need to do it four times, it's only three times, and they'll say, like, oh, I'm sorry, da-da-da-da-da-da-da. So, I guess how I handled it is just…I'm… I'm almost treating AI like it's my personal assistant, so if it makes a mistake, I will call it out on it, and hope that it doesn't make that mistake again, but I will still be checking for that mistake. Yeah, I try not to treat AI as if it's this perfect tool. I'm treating it almost as if it's just a very smart child, where it will learn things very quickly, but it can still make mistakes. So, holding it accountable, and then rechecking for those information, for the information that it's made wrong that's kind of how I'm operating with AI. Or the content that it makes. Interviewer: All right, thank you for sharing, SPR-S01. Did the subject 31269 BRM help you feel more prepared to make ethical decisions when using generative AI in academic or professional settings?"
student,31269,Spring,First,student,SPR-S01,SPR-S01,14,"Definitely. I think the fact that BRM was so forward in referencing AI, I thought that was really important. I think that, like, absolutely everyone is going to use AI, and it's incredibly powerful tool that I think should… that everyone should be educated on how to use, but it's also important that you learn how to reference it. Because if you… if you use it like it's your Bible, if you use it like it's the… the… the greatest tool there is, and that everything it says is factual, and you make it generate everything, then one, you're not learning anything from it. So, like, it feels, as I said before, like, disingenuous if you're submitting work that is just 100% AI-generated, and yet claiming it as your own. You can use facets of it, absolutely, and you can use it to supplement your thinking, but claiming it as your own, definitely not. So I think the BRM, like, the subject, did help in making ethical decisions in an academic and professional setting. Interviewer: Do you have a couple of examples for the kind of guidance it provided, or support the subject, BRM?"
student,31269,Spring,First,student,SPR-S01,SPR-S01,15,"Yeah. I really liked the, as I mentioned before, the referencing part. So I like that at the end of every class document, it provided a scaffold of how you would reference it, and an example, because it just creates that consistency. So, what, I did 13, 12 weeks? I already forgot. But basically, every single week, I'd see at the bottom of the bottom of the document, just, oh, you need to, you need to reference it like this. And I think I like how transparent… I think transparency is a really important thing with generative AI. Because if you're… as I mentioned before, if I… if I treat it like it's just a very smart child, or a very smart person, then, again, that's not content that I'm making, that's content that's something else or someone else is making. So it's important to clarify and make those, make those distinctions, visible. Interviewer: Great answer, thank you, SPR-S01. Interviewer: Next question. Do you find it difficult to understand your institution's policies, so UTS policies, on the ethical use of generative AI in assessments? Interviewer: If so, what aspects do you find unclear? So now, zooming out of…"
student,31269,Spring,First,student,SPR-S01,SPR-S01,16,"Give me 2 seconds, I'll just move closer to the Wi-Fi. Interviewer: Yep."
student,31269,Spring,First,student,SPR-S01,SPR-S01,17,"Yep. I would say…do you find it difficult to understand your…? Yes, I think the policies are inconsistent, or at least there's no set or based framework that's been applied. So, you know, in my IT subjects, in my cybersecurity subjects, majority of them are tech-related, it's a tech degree. So, there are… there's a lot of… maybe not transparency, but there is a lot of chatter, and… I guess, discussion about using AI, and even in the assessments, it'll mention, like, the use of generative AI will be dot dot dot. So, they can say you'll use it, but you need to use it carefully, or they'll say you can't use it at all. However, then, in my criminology degree, basically nothing is told about it. I think all the professors and teachers and tutors, they'll know that students will be using AI. However, when it comes to actual institution… institutional policies in regards to my criminology side of things, I see basically nothing. So, I think if there was a general, wide, you know, policy when it comes to AI, that would be a lot more powerful and important. But then also probably faculty-specific. I think that will… that will, yield, greater clarity for… for students, but then also for tutors and teachers. Because each degree will… will have AI's capabilities drawn in different ways. If you're doing an arts degree, then the fact that it can generate your content, generate an article, generate, you know, a drawing, a painting, an image, whatever, that's…pretty important when it's a large facet of your degree, but then when it comes to, you know, maybe a criminology degree or a social science degree, where there's a lot of critical analysis and AI is quite weak. Then, yes, you can use it, but it may not be the strongest thing, or yes, you can use it, but you need to reference that you've used it, so that, you know, you're not just trying to claim its work as your own. Interviewer: Amazing, SPR-S01. I will come back to it… because it's not part of my questions here, that's why I'm not allowed to ask it, but I will come back to the difference in faculties. Very interesting point. Thank you so much for sharing. Next question… Interviewer: And it's already the second last. So, what support do you need to use generative AI appropriately? So…anything in mind that you would like to see being offered?"
student,31269,Spring,First,student,SPR-S01,SPR-S01,18,"I think one thing that comes to mind is, I know at UTS, they have, like, a little pamphlet for how to do APA 7th referencing appropriately. And I've got that in my room, and I think you can find it online on the website as well. And it just makes it very clear on, you know, how you'd reference a book, a website, a journal article, whatever. I think having maybe something similar for AI, so perhaps prompts that you can give it to maximize effectiveness, or how to reference AI, and then also maybe some differences between the different AIs, like, you have the freedom… sorry, that might have been a bit loud. There's, like, a truck that went by. The… yeah, perhaps showing the differences between AI, so, you know, ChatGPT compared to Copilot, compared to whatever other ones that people want to use. I think that would be cool to have given out in, you know… I know the UTS library hands out stuff like that all the time, so perhaps that can be something that can be posted online, found on the website, but then also handed in pamphlets. That way, students are educated on what AI is, how to use it, when you can use it, and how you can reference it. I think that would be something that could, you know, support using AI appropriately. Interviewer: Have you looked into the student guide, which was provided on the subject page of BRM?"
student,31269,Spring,First,student,SPR-S01,SPR-S01,19,"I don't think I did, no. Or perhaps I did, but I've forgotten. Interviewer: Okay. Maybe, if you want, after this interview, you can have a look."
student,31269,Spring,First,student,SPR-S01,SPR-S01,20,"Yeah. Interviewer: And, maybe you can give me some feedback around the guidance provided there, and what could be maybe improved. I like your idea, thank you so much for sharing this."
student,31269,Spring,First,student,SPR-S01,SPR-S01,21,"No worries. Interviewer: Next question. And this is the last question…so if generative AI tools continue to be integrated into coursework similar to BRM, how do you think they should be used?"
student,31269,Spring,First,student,SPR-S01,SPR-S01,22,"I think, again, that depends on… that's a degree-specific, it will depend on what degrees you're doing. For the degrees that I'm doing, so a social science degree and a FEITs degree, like engineering, IT degree, I think integrating AI tools into coursework is very powerful. People are going to use AI no matter what, whether you tell them to or not, so you might as well incorporate it into natural coursework. And I think using it as a comparative tool is very, very, I think that that's important, or I think, using it as a comparative tool, or using it as a way to force or to get students to actually fact-check what they read, look at the reliability and the validity of it, I think that's important, because that's its own skill in itself. AI can churn something out, but if it's inaccurate and you submit it, you cop the loss. So that's on you. However, if AI churns something out and it's decent, and then you're able to physically look at it and go, okay, I'm going to tweak this, I want to edit this. But to, you know, answer the marking criteria or the rubric to a higher degree, I think that is an important skill that, that, that will do well for students, basically. I think that would… I think…yeah, I think that would be a powerful tool for students, and it would also make it somewhat easier for tutors as well, knowing that they've used AI. Like, already establishing that as a base means that you can only look at it up from there. There's no guesswork. So, yeah. Interviewer: I like it. Thank you, SPR-S01. One last sub-question. Are there risks you're concerned about, with more widespread use of generative AI tools?"
student,31269,Spring,First,student,SPR-S01,SPR-S01,23,"Absolutely. I hate the idea of people becoming… I like to call the use of AI almost like second thinkers, or second brains, where they have to… they cannot form a single thought by themselves, they have to have it through some sort of generative AI. I know my generation, we call them clankers. So, it's just…I want people to be able to… to be independent in thought, and be able to generate their own ideas, rather than having to, you know, validate it every single time through AI. I hate the idea that someone, you know, there'll be a question, it's me, oh, I'll ask ChatGPT. It's like, maybe just have a think for, like, 2 minutes, then see what you need to do. So I think that is definitely a risk and concern. It's that people are losing autonomy in how they're gonna think and act, especially when it comes to university assessments, where they're… rather than, you know, asking a tutor or emailing their tutor a teacher, the first thing they're doing is emailing or checking AI. So, I think there's a risk of, yeah, I guess just a lack of thought. People not using their brain or critically thinking. I think that's such a powerful skill. It's one that's heavily developed in year 11 and 12, like, just before you enter university, but then, you know, developing it to such a high degree to then basically throw it away when you get into Uni, that's a big problem. So, I think that's a large risk. Interviewer: Amazing. Thank you so much, SPR-S01le. Amazing interview, a lot of great information. I really appreciate the time that you took. About the voucher, we're gonna send it to you probably within the next week. Someone will contact you, not me, different person, different team. […] Interviewer: Yeah, thank you so much, SPR-S01. I just stopped the… I follow up."
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S01,SPR-S01,1,"Interviewer: I'm just gonna record this session for data analysis purposes, but everything will be anonymized, so your name won't appear anywhere. I hope that's okay for you."
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,2,"Yeah, that's fine, by the way. Interviewer: Cool, man. So maybe just as a quick introduction for today's session. So, today's session is mainly about understanding how students, like you engaged with generative AI tools like Copilot or ChatGPT in an AI-integrated subject, particular looking at 31269, business requirement modeling, which you took this spring semester, right?"
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,3,"Yep. Interviewer: Beautiful. And it's part of the UTS, first and further year experience grants and this study aims to understand how students engage, as I was already saying, with AI-integrated assessments, and also how students develop a more evaluative judgment for learning and reflection while using those tools. And I just prepared a couple of questions that we will go through, one by one, and I will always just paste the question also in the chat, so you can read it in your own time as well."
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,4,Okay. Interviewer: I hope that's all good for you.
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,5,"Yeah, that's fine. Interviewer: Beautiful. Alright, let's kick it off. First question, I just pasted in the chat. So how did you use generative AI tools, Copilot, ChatGPT, in the subject 31269?"
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,6,"I mostly used it for helping to understand the questions they gave us. Some of them, in particular, had us use generative AI to make diagrams, and then you had to make, like, comparisons between what we would make, and then what Copilot would make, for example. Yeah, that's mostly how I use it. Whenever I was lost or confused, it's just paste this in the AI, give it the scope, whatever it needs. Give it… what can you give me as this output, and then… yeah. Paste it in. Put in the appendix, and then, yeah, that's about it. Interviewer: Cool, man, if I remember correctly, it was part of intervention activities in week 5, 8, and 11. Can you maybe walk me through a specific example of those weeks, in terms of how you used it for the class activity? You already described a bit."
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,7,"Yeah, so, what I mentioned just then was week 11, which is when we had to make a diagram ourselves. I don't remember the specifics of the diagram, but you just… we had to make a diagram, and then we had to make, have Copilot generate the same diagram, but then we also had to make a comparison between the two. Just as the, I think it was, like, a use case diagram? Or something like that. It's just, you have to see what you missed, what you should add, what Copilot thinks. And then, yeah, just compare the two. Interviewer: Okay, cool, thank you. Next question, I'm just gonna paste it again into the chat, just one second."
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,8,Yep. Interviewer: Did you find generative AI tools helpful in completing assignments or assessments and tutorial activities?
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,9,"Yes, I did. If I had to elaborate on that, it's, AI just makes things easier. Usually, when you look at the, like, project brief, and it has all the descriptions with, like, the business owners, and… what you're supposed to do, like, the story. I remember for business modelling requirements in particular, they have this whole story, but here's… this is the business owner of Bright Bridge Learning, they're trying to make their system recruitment, better. They want improvements, it is just a whole slab of texts. So, personally, I like, you know, put that into AI, see what it outcomes, just have it summarize it, have it list anything you might miss, for example. It just… it makes things easy. You just… you get the summary, and you just… it's easier to understand, because you're not just reading this big slab of text, it's just faster and more efficient. Interviewer: Makes sense. Do you recall any other types of assessments where you use generative AI? Maybe quizzes, video-making activities, infographics, pivot tables, reflections, reports, presentations?"
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,10,"I did use it for… oh gosh, what was I about to say? This is a different subject. I did use it a little bit for coding, just when I'm lost, it really makes it easy. You missed this, it's like you're pasting your code, it's like, oh, I missed the semicolon there or something, and you feel a little silly afterwards, but…"
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,11,"Yeah… what else did I use it for? I use it for script generation. Sometimes it's, like, you write your own script, and then you have AI write up a script, see if you missed anything, compare the two, then just rewrite it all together. Yeah, that's about all I can think of at the moment. Interviewer: That's a lot, thank you. Was there anything it wasn't really helpful for, that you can recall?"
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,12,"Oof. Not really, no. I do think some AIs are better than others, in a way. I think, like, ChatGPT is way more helpful than Copilot, for example. But, It's just… Copilot generally doesn't give me the output I desire as much. With, like, the information I give it. So, in that way, it is unhelpful. Interviewer: In terms of quality, or in terms of…"
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,13,Just everything. Interviewer: Okay.
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,14,"But I… if you had, yeah, definitely quality."
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,15,"I just…as an AI model, I'd personally prefer, like, ChatGPT, just because it gives me more so what I desire compared to other models. Interviewer: All right. Next question. How did your confidence in using AI tools for learning change throughout the past semester? Maybe you have some examples."
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,16,"My confidence in AI hasn't really changed, just because I've been using it for, like, what, 2 years now? Consistently, I used it throughout high school. I used it the start of this year, all the way up until now. I don't really have any examples for that either, it's just… I'm very familiar with AI, so… I don't… wouldn't say my confidence has changed at all. Interviewer: Okay, thank you. Next question. How easy or difficult was it to critically assess the quality and the accuracy of AI-generated content for you?"
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,17,"Oh, sorry, just give me a second, I need a burp. Interviewer: All good."
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,18,"Ugh. I would say it has been… Somewhat… easy, in a way? Just because when I use AI, I usually… like, for example, if I'm pasting in, like, an assignment briefing, or I'm trying to understand something, I usually like to read it myself first. So, I'll read it myself first, and then I'll paste it in the AI, see what it spits out. Usually, it's easy to tell if something just isn't right there. You'll just notice, like, an outlier, or just something that doesn't fit in the project, into… or the assignment, into what ChatGPT or Copilot spits out, for example."
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,19,"So, I would say it's been quite easy. Interviewer: You have any other signs or indicators that you pay attention to, except outliers, to judge the quality or accuracy?"
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,20,"I don't know, question everything is usually the point I have on it. If I'm not too sure on something, I usually, question it myself, so if it spits out a statistic with a link, make sure you click the link. Check it out, I've noticed it's been unreliable with, like, statistics, for example. So I'm always quick to question whether or not it's trying to, just make up a statistic, or whether or not this is true or false. From my experience, as I said, you click on the link, and then usually it says something like, page not found. And then I have it redo the links, and it's like, oh, here's some modern updates, and then it gives me an actual statistic. Interviewer: Okay, great. Thank you, SPR-S01. Next question. I think you already answered some parts of it, but what strategies did you use to verify the reliability of AI-generated responses? You were just mentioning clicking on some of the links, double-checking them, any other strategies in mind?"
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,21,"Usually, it's just, depending on what it spits out, just… I don't know, I'd make sure to double-check everything. Just because you can never know how truly reliable it is. So yeah, as I mentioned, you just double-check links. If it gives you a statistic, you double-check that. Always… Interviewer: …consult other sources, maybe, sometimes? Like, cross-referencing?"
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,22,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's all I can think of for the moment. Interviewer: And how much time did you typically spend verifying the content?"
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,23,"It's usually… it doesn't usually take too long. Because I usually do it in, like, chunks. So, I would, like, verify one section or one thing before I move to the next. So, that could range from, like, 5 to 15 minutes. Alright, great, thank you. Interviewer: Next question. Were there moments where you realized AI-generated content was incorrect or misleading, and how did you handle that? You already mentioned some?"
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,24,"Yeah. If I just go back to my example with statistics and all of that, like I said, just double-check everything. If it gives me a statistic, or like, it doesn't sound right, or something, click on the link, and then how I would handle that is I usually just tell the AI, oh, this… these statistics are wrong, can you please redo them? And then, I know with ChatGPT, for example, it starts to cite more recent statistics. So it does, like, a double-check on links. And then it… I don't know exactly how it works, but then it starts to spit out what I want. Like, more recent, true, not any, like, misleading information. So, I don't know, usually how I handle it is I just tell the AI that it's wrong. Interviewer: And what made you realize that content is wrong in statistics? Is it just learning… by mistake, or…"
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,25,"Yeah, oh…I don't really know how to put it, it's just, like, from, like, my knowledge of what I'm studying, or what I'm trying to understand, if something doesn't sit right…you know, I think it's really quick and easy to tell whether or not it's gonna spit me something out that's true or false. So, I guess, like, it's sort of built, like, on experience and seeing that it can sometimes give out, like, wrong or misinformation in a way. Interviewer: All right. Next question. Did the subject help you feel more prepared to make ethical decisions when using generative AI in academic or professional settings? So, back to 31269?"
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,26,"Yeah, I would say so. I do like having the appendix on the bottom of every worksheet that says, oh, just paste how you used AI in here. I think they did a good job of making it always sound like you should use it as, like, a tool, and not as something that you should just, like, cheat through the entire subject with. I really like that sense of the use of AI. Yeah, that's about all for me. Interviewer: Alright, next question. Do you find it difficult to understand your institution's policies on the ethical use of generative AI in assessments, so UTS policies?"
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,27,"Not particularly. I can't think of anything that's unclear with it. Most subjects, for example, give a clear outline of how they want you to use AI and engage with it. So far from what I know, it's just they have the appendix or the appendices at the bottom of the page. Paste what you put in here, you should only use it as a tool. So, I think it's clear. I don't think any of it's unclear so far. Interviewer: Okay, so you're pretty satisfied with the way… especially 31269 explained to you how to use it, where to use it, and how to reference it."
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,28,Yep. Interviewer: So you never really felt unsure about whether you use… whether your use of generative AI was within the policies.
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,29,"Yeah. Interviewer: Alright, next question. Is there maybe any other support that you need to use generative AI appropriately?"
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,30,"I'm not too sure on that. Interviewer: For example, would you… would extra workshops, or drop-in sessions, or tutorials, or in-class discussions around it be even more helpful for you, or…"
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,31,"I think not for me in particular, just because I'm so familiar with it, but perhaps for other students, I would say that having, like, an in-class discussion, or maybe even, like, a tutorial dedicated to the use of AI would be pretty useful. Interviewer: So you never really hesitated to ask questions… to ask for help, using those tools, because your proficiency was already quite high."
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,32,"Yeah. Interviewer: Okay, great. Interviewer: Next, and it's already the last question for Interviewer: Quick one. If generative AI tools continue to be integrated into coursework, how do you think they should be used?"
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,33,"Yeah, I did sort of touch on this earlier. I reckon they should always be, exemplified as used as a tool. You should always ever use it just to make, some sort of, like, mundane task a bit easier or simpler to understand. Like, for example, I know in business requirements modelling, it asks you to, like, list a certain amount of things from this description or something. Or, like, yeah, you need to, like, list something, for example, you should… paste the script it gives you in there, and have AI spit out the answer, and then just see if it might have missed anything, or just double-check your answer, see if what it's saying is correct, and then move on. I just reckon there should always be framed as a tool and nothing more. Interviewer: So even in assessments, you feel like it should be more a tool, a collaborator, but not really taking the lead."
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,34,"Yeah. Cause you can't really say it's your own work, then, or that… you're not gonna learn anything if all you do is just use AI for every little bit of your assignments or assessment. You gotta use it as something that can make things or tasks easier. It's always just been my stance on it. Interviewer: Okay. Are there risks you're concerned about with more widespread use?"
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,35,"The risks… I do think it makes people a lot lazier. Because they just think, oh, I can, like, leave this assignment, or I can leave this task to the last minute and then an hour before it's due, I can just paste it all in the ChatGPT and it would just do all the work for me. I do think there are risks associated with…people becoming lazier, and… they're not as proficient as, like, knowing what they're supposed to know. I do think it will remove some knowledge and skills that might be necessary in the future. Interviewer: That's also something you already witnessed in your cohorts of students?"
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,36,"Yeah, it definitely is something I've witnessed already. Interviewer: Alright, great, SPR-S01, thank you so much for your time. Do you have any questions for me?"
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,37,"No, I haven't got anything. Interviewer: Okay, amazing. Thank you so much for today, and there will be a student team reaching out to you about the voucher, okay?"
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,38,"Alright. Interviewer: Beautiful. Thank you, SPR-S01. Have a great day."
student,31269,Spring,Second,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,39,"You too, thank you."
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S02,SPR-S02,1,"Interviewer: For data analysis purposes, I will record this session, but everything will be anonymized, so your name won't appear anywhere. I hope that's okay for you."
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,2,"Yeah, no, that's fine. Interviewer: Beautiful. Interviewer: Okay, maybe just as a quick introduction, so today's session is about understanding how students like you engage with generative AI tools in AI-integrated subjects, like business requirement modelling, 31269, which you took this semester, right?"
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,3,"That's correct. Interviewer: Yeah. Interviewer: And it's part of the UTS FFYE grant, and the FFYE grant is the first and further year experience grant and this overall goal of the study is to understand how we can maybe improve AI-integrated subjects and assessments, and also how we could develop a better evaluative judgment skill for students, linked to the use of generative AI. Is there any questions from your side before we start with the interview questions?"
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,4,"No, not really. Interviewer: Cool, man. I will just copy and paste the questions into the chat, so you can also read them, question by question, okay? So, the first question… How did you use generative AI tools like Copilot or ChatGPT in this subject, 31269?"
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,5,"Okay. So, off the top of my head, I think there were 3 main ways. So…first, it's worth me, pointing out, or at least asking you first, do you know how BRM is usually taught, or how it works internally? Interviewer: Maybe just explain it to me as if I wouldn't know."
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,6,"Yeah, okay. So essentially, within the unit, we are… I guess, simulating or trying to become business analysts, and we do this primarily through analyzing case studies, or at least two major case studies. And so, these two major case studies, they… one has a lot of dialogue and context, whereas the other one is purely context, but doesn't specifically outline the problems from a first-person narrative. So I guess one of the primary ways that I notice myself and my other teammates and some other people in my tutorial using AI, Is by first feeding the dialogue, or the entire narrative of the case study, into the LLM. And then saying, hey, can you guys just compress this? Can you just basically regurgitate it in a much more simplified manner and outline the issues that are apparent firsthand? So I guess that's one major way that we've used it. A second way that we've used it quite a bit is… and this is internal to the subject. The tutors have actually instructed us, hey, we're gonna make you guys do a sequence of tasks and then we're gonna also get you to then ask LLMs, more specifically, Copilot to do the same task that you did, with the same instructions, and then we want you to compare the two. They didn't necessarily say, hey, show the discrepancies or the flaws of AI, but they just said, compare the two. So I guess, in that way, they're really trying to, you know, I guess, maxim sense into students and say, hey, you can't really trust it for everything. And I think the third way, and the probably more negatively cared way that people are using it in this unit, is literally to just do their work for them. Like, that's no secret, there are students who literally just say, hey, analyze this case study for me, I want you to do all the questions for me. But yeah, those are the main ways that I've seen it being used in this unit. Interviewer: All right, amazing, Ray. Thank you so much. Great answer for the first question. Let's move on to the second question. I just paste it into the chat. Did you find generative AI helpful in completing assessments, or assisting?"
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,7,"I say yes. That the fact you can just give it the narrative, and it will regurgitate the keen, takeaways, or the points that you should be looking at more specifically, and outlines, hey, this is a point of error. You can address it through so-and-so options. That was very helpful. Like, usually it does provide an insight that you would otherwise miss, even if you have 5 other teammates. No, yeah, I'd say it was very positive, the way we've used AI in this subject. And in terms of assessments, If we're talking about assessments specifically that are graded, I'd say a little bit, and that's only because by the time you get to the assessment, you've already analyzed the case study enough to almost regurgitate to yourself and to others, if they were to ask. But we are also…not exactly encouraged to use AI, but if we do use AI, we are told to specify how we used it and when we used it for which parts at the bottom of our assessment. Though my team has hardly ever had to really do that. But I would still say it's been quite helpful. Interviewer: Great. Was there anything it wasn't really helpful for? Can you recall something?"
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,8,"I'd say making certain diagrams. So, going back to BRM specifically, we have to do what's called a sequence flow diagram, which is essentially looking at how…various objects, interact with each other within a system and giving the AI Complex tasks such as those, where it needs to look at not vastly large, but…somewhat complex, relationships that are a bit more…in tune to just human emotions, or intuition…made the AI, I guess, jitter here and there. So, the diagrams would often have incomplete relationships, or they would be flawed in terms of consistency when it comes to syntax. But, other than that, it was okay. Interviewer: Beautiful, thank you. Can you maybe recall any other types of assessments that generative AI helped with? Maybe quizzes, video making activities, infographics, pivot tables, reflections, reports, presentations, maybe also looking at other subjects, not only 31269?"
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,9,"Yeah, no, it has been quite helpful. I remember there was a specific time. It's not exclusive to me, but…I had a friend close to me ask me, hey."
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,10,"And for context, he's doing a degree of teaching, so he's trying to become a primary school teacher. He was like, hey, we're doing this, like, I guess, problem solving quiz or exercise, and essentially what it was is… it was a scenario where there was a substitute teacher who had to get the task done, but then the task was delayed due to some unknown factor. And I remember I provided my friend, I guess, a sequence of steps to follow. It's like, hey, if I were you, I'd probably say so-and-so for this situation. And then, it was kind of funny, because he…replied back to me with, oh my god, that's exactly what AI told me. Right, and I'm just like, okay, that's a little insultful, but that's okay. Yeah, so I think it has been quite useful across the board, not exclusive to BRM. The one…main… or… I don't know if it's still an error, because I don't take math subjects anymore, but I remember last year when AI was still exploding and on the rise when it comes to usage, it was horrible at math. Math is, like, really where it just sucks. But everywhere else, it does seem to be quite good, especially if you're just getting it to either condense chunks of information that you are feeding it. Or sometimes, it's a hit or miss. Sometimes it's decently good at researching for you, but even then, I wouldn't allow it to make the final judgment. Interviewer: All right, thank you, Ray. Let's move on to the next question. How did your confidence in using AI tools for learning change throughout the past semester?"
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,11,"I would probably say it hasn't changed that much. But I'd say the confidence is quite high. So… I think it's worth me, noting here, I'm not like a… avid and hyper-consistent AI user. I do use, ChatGPT mainly as the main model. I don't use any other, like video editing AIs, or Photoshop, anything of that nature, but… more so LLMs. But for learning, specifically, I would say it stayed consistently high. So, for example, whenever I was confused and I didn't have the luxury to walk up to my lecturer and say, hey, how does this work? I'd usually just resort to AI. Which became a bit of a problem, because I did notice that I would often ask it first, rather than actually searching it up on an engine of sorts, so, for example, Google. But then, of course, afterwards, then I'd have to go double-check with other sources. And I guess that did take up quite a lot of time, but the part that we're… yeah, the part where it really, really helps, and I guess boosts confidence, is when you're asking, hey, if this theory remains true, and this theory is somewhat linked to it, would you say so-and-so proposition would be true? And then when it reaffirms you, or outlines the flaws within your idea, that's where it really gives you that boost, because now you're connecting the dots for yourself. And you're not making it make the judgment for you, if that makes sense. And that way, you're not actually getting to do much research, but rather analyze your own flaws. So I guess, in terms of learning, AI definitely does help. Like, I remember… I think I was in semester one, and for context, I'm not sure if this is ex- if this interview's exclusive to first years, but I'm a first year. Interviewer: Yeah, it is."
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,12,"Right. So, I'm a first year, I was in semester one, and AI was very, very popular by then. I remember it was week 3, and this one concept that was…for me, at least, very tricky to understand. I remember I was sitting down at my desk, typing away to ChatGPT, and I was just so curious, how were people, before the age of AI, able to learn this unit without AI? So I would say…the AI has given me a lot of confidence when it comes to my learning throughout the semester, and not just this semester, but all semesters that I've gone through. Interviewer: Beautiful. Thank you so much, great answer. Next question…How easy or difficult was it to critically assess the quality and accuracy of AI-generated content for you?"
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,13,"I think it depends on the type of output, or media output, that the LLM gives you. So, for example, I mentioned earlier that BRM specifically does make you criticize the usage of AI. But more so towards diagrams. So when it's a visual representation, it's often very easy to tell, hey, this doesn't look right, there's a flaw in the formatting, or maybe they're just using the wrong syntax for certain descriptions. But when it's more so of a conceptual and, I guess, written-out output, it's a bit more tricky, because then you have to be very careful, because often it does hide those flaws within what seem to be correct concepts. So, when it comes to looking at diagrams, I'd say it's very easy, but if it's anything where it's, hey, can you research so-and-so topic for me? And then you go research the topic for yourself. It's a bit more tricky, because it takes up a lot more time, and then you have to actually go through all of the information that is brought up, and usually it does bring up quite a few concepts at once. But even then, I wouldn't say it's too hard. I'd say maybe, like, medium difficulty. Interviewer: Do you have any signs or indicators that you use in those cases to judge the quality, where it's a bit more tricky?"
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,14,"Not firsthand. I'd only… maybe… the best response I could give that is maybe it looks too good to be true. Honestly. Because I do remember there was an assignment that I did last semester where I was just fact-checking the certain, I guess, elements of yeah, I guess… I guess a certain element of my assignment. And I asked it a simple question, I'm like, hey, does it do so-and-so this? And if it can do this, can it do it to this, right? So, it was… not a direct, link I was asking to make. It was a… make a link to this, and then link it to this. So the second link is the major link that I'm after, but it can only exist with the first link. And I remember when I asked it the specific questions between the links, it said, yeah, it can make it. And then I was like, okay, now I want to see where it got this information from. And I remember, no matter how much web scraping I did, so my own, you know, research through Google, whatever. I could not find that connection at all. And then, at the end, I was like, okay, I'm going to assume it's just hallucinating, because despite all my efforts, and I'm talking maybe, like, 3 hours of research, I could not find a single paper, a single website or article to support what it said. So, in that sense, I just had to disregard what it gave me at first. But it took so much effort that it basically… gave me no return, and I was actually at a loss in terms of time and effort. Interviewer: Sounds like you have a very role model behaviour in terms of evaluating the output of generative AI, which is great. But do you have any situations where you trusted the tool maybe too much in mind during your studies, or not really? You're always quite critical with the output?"
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,15,"Hmm… Actually, could you repeat that question for me? Just in case I miss… Interviewer: Yeah, so…were there any situations where you trusted the generative AI tool too much in your studies, without double checking, without, critically evaluating the output it provided? It sounds like you have a very role model behaviour in terms of…also, I mean cross-referencing and cross-checking the output."
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,16,"Maybe. So, I think the best… So, yeah, I feel like I have… But I usually end up checking at the very end anyways. So I… not with every prompt, so… to clarify. When I am using it for my learning, like I said before, I'm usually asking it to…I guess, confirm my understanding between two concepts and how they intertwine. And usually it's not just two. It usually stacks upon a foundational level understanding. As I am a first year, we have to build our foundations first. So, I first ask it upon the foundations, and then I go a step higher, and then a step higher, and then a step higher. And I guess I probably did trust it too much when I got to maybe the second or third step, because at that point, I'm making a lot of, I guess, risky links that aren't explicitly outlined in papers that you would search up for. So I guess from that perspective, I would say, yeah, I have excessively trusted its output. And I probably didn't fact-check at every single, I guess, level that I went up whhen I came… when it comes to those understandings. Interviewer: Alright, thank you, Ray. The next question, you already answered quite well, but maybe you want to add some more. So what strategies did you use to verify the reliability of AI-generated responses? You were already mentioning some web scraping, your own research, cross-referencing, having some sort of ongoing conversation to also… double-check your own thought flow? Anything else that you want to add in terms of strategies?"
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,17,"Yeah, maybe… maybe two. So, one would be explicitly asking the LLM, hey, where did you get this information from? Because sometimes it just… it doesn't do that. And I think it's really worth noting that you should be doing that. The second is…similar, but a little different, is… and I think it depends on the AI that you're using. At least with ChatGPT, when you ask it an output, it actually gives you, like, this little hyperlink at the bottom of its output, saying, hey, this is where we got all the information from. I think I would usually refer to those sources after I've read its output, not before, which may be good or bad. But yeah, I'd say those two. Either explicitly asking it for its sources, or looking at the sources that it's given you, and then critiquing it for yourself, and then you would also then follow up with, hey, give me any other sources that you may have used. Interviewer: Okay, great. Thank you, Ray. And how much time, roughly, did you typically spend verifying the content? You were mentioning earlier, you spent, for one occasion, 3 hours, but, maybe, do you have, like, any estimate in mind, like… it obviously also depends on the task that you're, pursuing, but… Just a general estimation."
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,18,"Yeah, no, it does depend on the task. I would say if it was simple weekly lectures. For the entire lecture, I'd spend maybe…20 minutes, 25 minutes, just re-evaluating, hey, can I actually trust this? But if it's an assignment, yeah, it can be much longer. Like I said earlier, 3 hours was the most I've ever done. But even then, that was like a one-off. So I'd say maybe an hour and a half for an assessment. Interviewer: Alright, thank you, Ray. Next question. Were there moments where you realized AI-generated content was incorrect or misleading, and how did you handle that?"
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,19,"Yeah. Yeah, so this goes back to what I said earlier. So it gave me…I guess a secondary output… I don't know how to exactly explain this, where I linked two ideas. I'm like, hey, if we can do this, can it do this? Yeah, so I noticed. Interviewer: It's, like, created new knowledge that is actually not out there."
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,20,"Yeah, so, I'll be a bit more specific. I was asking it, hey, can… sound go through this certain amount of timber, given its thickness. I didn't give it the type of timber, I just said, hey, if it's this thick or, this dense, do you think sound could get through, given that the sound is at this level of decibels? It confidently gave me a yes. And I was like, oh, okay, this actually works out great for me. But, it doesn't matter…but the thing is, it looks a little too good, because I felt like it was just reaffirming my hopes, if that makes sense. So, I guess that's one moment. But how did I handle it? Oh, I think I just had to… I had to scrap away the idea completely, honestly. Like, after doing all that research and trying to find it for myself without the help of LLMs, and I couldn't find it, I just had to scrap the idea. Do you think that answers your question? Interviewer: Yeah, beautiful. That's an example, thank you. Next question. Did the subject help you so 31269 feel more prepared to make ethical decisions when using generative AI in academic or professional settings?"
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,21,"Yes, and I think… And I think it's worth me saying that this unit that I just took, BRM, it is probably the only subject that has helped me make more ethical decisions when it comes to generative AI. Especially when it comes to academic or professional settings, and I think that's explicitly because they've given us tasks throughout the semester where they're like, hey, compare your own output to that of Gen AI's. And I guess, when you're analyzing the two outputs, and you're looking for the differences, you can analyze the, I guess, stark differences in the flaws within Gen AI that's usually found. Sometimes it did…and this is sometimes, sometimes it did outline our own flaws, but more often than not, it had much, much more flaws in its own than ours. And I think that's just a really good implementation. I was honestly really surprised when I first saw that. I found it to be a really good thing. Interviewer: Nice also, in regards to how to reference and acknowledge genitive AI use? How was that in the subject?"
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,22,"I think it was done fairly well. So, like I said earlier, the university doesn't exactly… condemn AI usage, but at the same time Copilot is allowed to be used, as long as you are referencing it at the bottom of your document. So we usually have one part that's saying, hey, put all your references here, and then appendices here, and then in the references, you'll just say, hey, I used this module of Copilot, of this version, on this date for so and so task. So, I guess that's kind of how we did it. Other than that, we didn't really do much. Interviewer: Next question, to link back to what you just said, do you find it difficult to understand your institution's UTS policies on the ethical use of generative AI in assessments?"
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,23,"No. I would say it's fairly clear, so…From what I can see, it's… You can use it. Though, if you do use it, you have to reference it. The one unclear aspect of its usage that I don't know myself is how much can you use it? So, for example, can I get it to do my entire task? And just say in the references, hey, I got it to do literally every single task, but just so you know, I did use Copilot, and you guys like Copilot. So I would say…it's clear as to how you should use it, but it's not clear as to how much you should be using it. Interviewer: Great answer, thank you. Next question. What support do you need to use genitive AI appropriately?"
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,24,"Hmm… Is that question more so external for myself, or just my own actions? Interviewer: Think about maybe extra workshops, drop-in sessions, tutorials, or in-class discussions, so for you as students at UTS…so, do you think that any extra support is needed, would be useful?"
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,25,"Maybe not because I… and I say that only because I feel like, with the rise of AI, with the rise of AI, everyone's, I guess, In a way, grown up with it, or grown with it, so through trial and error over the refined versions of the LLM, because in its early days, it used to… it used to give the most…I wouldn't say vague, but irrelevant outputs. And I guess over time, it's really gotten good of assuming what you mean, depending on your language and your vocabulary. So in terms of supports, I wouldn't say it's really needed, because most people already have that foundational understanding of, hey, if I want the AI to give me this sort of response, maybe I should frame it like this. And I feel like for maybe 8 or 9 times out of 10. It usually gets it done really, really well. So, in terms of supply, I wouldn't say there is much needed. Interviewer: Right? Interviewer: Thank you, Ray. We already had our last question, so the next is the last. If generative AI tools continue to be integrated into coursework at UTS, how do you think they should be used?"
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,26,"I think… I think BRMs take, or, I guess, frame of action, as it is right now, is a really good one. So…personally, from what I've seen, is that if I know anyone that has used generative AI tools as a first line of…I guess, work… completing their work, it usually ends really badly. And I say that in the sense that they don't even attempt to do the task at hand. Instead, they just get AI to do it for them, and then they double-check. Whereas, I find those who actually do the task at hand first and then only if then there's an error, and then they go to the LLM and say, hey, can you assess what I've done here? Can you see if what I did is correct? I think integrating it in the sense where you're using it as a fact-checker rather than a method to actually complete your work is really good. So, going back to BRM, you would give your own output, what your group has done and then you would give the same sequence of steps and instructions to the LLM, and then it gives you the output, and then you are then to analyze between the two and find each other's flaws. So I think that's really good when you're using it to, I guess, find flaws, but only after you've done the task at hand. But yeah, I think going forward, it should only really be used As a comparative tool. And only after you've done the work, rather than you…asking it first, and then you doing the work. Interviewer: Right, and one last sub-question to this question. Are there risks you're concerned about with the more widespread use?"
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,27,"Yeah, yeah, definitely. Noticeably, or maybe not noticeably, because I am a first-year student, but…as we're having this interview, I actually have an assessment due soon. And this assessment is essentially a collage of all the theory that we've learned in maybe, I'd say, the past 5 or 6 weeks. One thing that I've noticed is that my group members who were more reliant on generative AI throughout the semester. They're a lot more… I guess, indecisive, or…they simply don't know where to start when it comes to the assessment for certain aspects. So I feel like having a greater reliance on AI usually leads to a dependence, innately. And because of that, I feel like some people can feel stuck when there isn't AI there to help them. And I guess, in that sense, it's a little worrying, because then you have to ask yourself, okay, what about if we take this situation and go beyond the environment of just learning? What happens if it's just your everyday tasks? Like, I've heard from people asking AI, hey, how should I plan my day? When that used to be such a common thought for people literally just 20 years ago to have to themselves, rather than them asking it into some web browser and having a generative AI tell them. So I guess… In a way, its excessive usage has…almost led to dependence on something that isn't even living. And I guess from that standpoint, it's a little scary, because then you're no longer yourself, you're more so controlled by something that isn't alive or organic. So yeah, I'd say that's my response. Interviewer: Amazing. Thank you so much, Ray. Amazing answers, really great interview. I really appreciate the time that you spent today for it. Is there any last questions that you want to ask me?"
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,28,"Yeah, actually."
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,29,"I would probably… Yeah, I'd say I'm mostly curious as to how the information for the survey is actually going to be used. So I heard earlier, I think you mentioned that it's used for analyzing first use specifically, and how we're using it. But what is the main goal when it comes to that? Interviewer: The main goal is to better support university in actually integrating AI into more subjects, similar to the subject that you took with 31269. So, kind of, like, finding some relevant data around it, how students engaged with it, how it was useful, how it was maybe, not useful, and to see how we can maybe change even curriculums in certain subjects, especially looking at first year students, because this FFYE grant is part of, first-year space. But it can be also, obviously, utilized for second and third-year students as well. But yeah, that's kind of the main purpose of it. To get… not only gather information from students, but also teaching and teaching staff, because it's affecting all of us, not only students, but also, obviously, tutors and lecturers at university as well. And both of them have to adjust and, yeah, I think it's really important that university will move more quickly, in the near future, and do the right changes, and hopefully the information that we gather through this one-year research project will help."
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,30,"Okay, yeah, I can see that. Like, personally, I do agree, in the sense that I guess you shouldn't be fighting the usage of AI, and that's only because it's just so accessible. Like, if you ask a student to say, not say, but… don't use AI. They're inevitably just going to go against your command and go, hey, you know what, I can literally just go into my web browser and use it without even you noticing. So I feel like…from that perspective, it's really good that you guys are actually addressing a core issue of ethics, and it's sustainable usage. Interviewer: Yep. That's really important, 100%. Not only for university, but for society, and university is obviously a big part of society, so, it's important that we make the right changes these days."
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,31,"Okay. Yeah, no, sounds like a good initiative. Interviewer: Yep. Thank you so much, Ray. There will be a UTS team that will contact you for the voucher, for your time."
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,32,"Okay, yeah. Interviewer: So yeah, if you have any other questions that might come up later, feel free to reach out, yeah?"
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,33,"Do I send it to your email? Interviewer: I can send it to my email, that's right."
student,31269,Spring,Third,student,SPR-S03,SPR-S03,34,"Okay, yeah, sounds great. Interviewer: Beautiful. Interviewer: Thank you so much."
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,1,"Yeah sure. Interviewer: I think you're already quite aware of the Grant project, right?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,2,Yeah. Interviewer: Should we then just start straight away with the interview questions?
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,3,Please. Interviewer: Yeah. Have you had a chance to look at it in advance.
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,4,"Not yet, to be honest now. Interviewer: Okay? Oh, good, even better, I feel like. Okay, let's just start with the 1st question, what was your level of familiarity with generative AI tools. Before teaching the subject?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,5,"Yeah, I mean, as like a normal academic, I used to use language models specifically ChatGPT, and then I use the language model of Google over my Whatsapp. So yeah, pretty much. I worked with them as a, as a tools, as a normal user. Interviewer: Mostly those 2 tools? Or do you have any other?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,6,Just this. Interviewer: Yeah. Okay. How frequently do you use generative AI tools in your professional work for teaching?
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,7,"Occasionally, I'm using the language model. Not not much, but it's not like that. I don't use it, so I use it, but mainly sometimes for getting some idea or helping write up my idea yet. So, just assisting myself, I'm using them Generative AI Interviewer: So you're using it for teaching, administration, or research?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,8,"Mainly for research, mainly for research and communication. Mainly for communication, I should say. Interviewer: To improve language?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,9,"To improve language and improve my communication skills, yeah. Sometimes if I need some specific questions, I'm asking generative AI, but not much. Interviewer: Okay. Great. Prior to this subject, had UTS provided you with any training, resources, or support on ethical use of generative AI in education?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,10,"They, they provide some, they provide some guidelines. But yeah, I did not focus much on on them, because it was not mandatory. But yes, they provided some resources. Interviewer: Do you remember what kind of resources it was?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,11,Like some online explanation and guidelines.. how we can use it as to how we should use it. That that's it. Interviewer: What additional support or training would you like to see offered in the future?
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,12,"Yeah, exactly, if there is a like a tailored workshop that tell us how we can use generative AI to improve our teaching would be nice. So yeah, prefer not like a boring workshop. Just very, you know, very effective practical workshop with lots of nice example would be useful. Interviewer: So you you're saying you would prefer a more hands on approach."
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,13,"Yes, a more hands on approach with nice example. Yeah, different subject example from different, you know, subject. And because we are teaching computer science specifically for computer science would be nice. Interviewer: Okay, nice. Interviewer: How did you integrate generative AI into your teaching or assessment feedback during your subject?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,14,"For feedback. I don't use the generative AI. But for teaching we have one specific activity, I think in week 7 or 8 of totally all of my subject and then we ask the students use language model like a ChatGPT, and I think we use the UTS one like Copilot to come up with the…how they can use like a language model to improve their understanding for brainstorming, and generally how they can help them to, I mean for better learning journey. Interviewer: What was your experience?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,15,"Some of them, they they use it in a nice way, some of them, but for some of them again I felt that they need very targeted workshop with a nice example, like we are starting with with explaining that…just assume that, okay, you don't use the language model, you get this when you use the language model, if you use it in a nice way, a smart way, we show them how that assistant can help them. So somehow, coming up with a smart top example which inspire them how to use language model. Interviewer: You were saying some of them use it in a nice way. Do you have an example, like what was this?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,16,"I cannot remember the example to be honest, but I find that some of them they had a niche idea on how they can use it to improve their understanding. I just forget the example. But some of them they had a niche idea. But to me, if if they don't have a niche idea maybe it's become a bit boring for them. They don't know how to use it. So somehow, to me they should use it to improve their idea, make them more creative rather than just doing for copying the assignment, or, you know, just for bit unethical usage for the education. But for that I think that some of them they can do it, but some of them they need help, and that help should come from at least, you know, 20-50 inspiring example. So as a UTS, if the UTS can provide that database would be interesting. Interviewer: Okay? Great. Next question. Next question, in your opinion, what were the most significant challenges in incorporating generative AI into your teaching or assessments?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,17,"Yeah, the 1st challenge is, I mean, as a normal academic…we are constrained with the timing. So I need a you know, free mind to think that how we can use it. And again, as I explained that because it's not very specific guideline or workshops or tutorials tell us how you can use it. Everyone just use the language model in their own way. So it's not much sources available, or at least I did not look to find the nice sources. So to me is, that is, the main challenges. Interviewer: So just to make sure that I understood it in the right way. So the main challenge, you see, in aligning all the different teaching styles. So because there's multiple people involved in."
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,18,"Yes. Interviewer: In your observation, did the use of generative AI tools influence, student engagement, learning approaches or assessment performance."
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,19,"Some of them. Yes, but they still, I think that we need very direct guided tutorial, to tell them how they can use it. So I did not see much positive example. I feel that some of them they are using the like a ChatGPT. Regarding one of my assignment, when we are asking for future idea or visionary idea, some of them they use that one in nice way, I understand, but because I did not check with them, I don't know exactly whether that is my assumption or really they get the support in a nice way from Generative AI. Interviewer: Do you have any examples for maybe a negative impact that you observed?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,20,"Yeah, generally. I mean, I'm not seeing for my undergraduate student. But sometimes I saw with some students like a HDR student, that when we are asking some research question or research task…just get some boring stuff from generative AI. But for the research, it should come with a niche idea."
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,21,"So, yeah, I saw those example that people coming up with a boring, repeated, repeated the stuff or general knowledge from language model, which which is not useful. Interviewer: And in regards to assessment performance, could you see any or do you realize any observation, positive or negative for your students?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,22,"Positive. I'm not sure but for negative, because I feel that, for example, my assignment, the last assignment is about data analysis and I feel that some of them they're using ChatGPT to coming up with their assessment, which for sure the ChatGPT answer is not 100% accurate or comprehensive. I think that is, that's a negative implication of language, model. Interviewer: All right. Thank you. Next question, while marking, did you observe whether students were able to critically, evaluate AI generated content? Or did they tend to rely on it without verification?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,23,"Think they tend to... I don't know, because there is, there's no way to be for us, understand whether they use it or not, but I feel that some of them, they use it in a you know, not a smart way. Some of them. They get the support from generative AI for reshaping the idea. So yeah, so that I saw the mix response from students. Interviewer: Do you have any strategy to help students to develop an evaluative judgment for generative AI."
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,24,"There's I think I need myself. I need some specific training and based on that, yes, I think it would be useful. Interviewer: You have maybe any strategies or interventions in mind that could better support the development of students critical evaluation?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,25,"Yeah. Again if I get access to those databases and are coming up with a nice crafted tutorial, tell them you know we use it in this way, and you see the see the impact. Then I'm sure that if we teach them they understand how they can use it. And it's it can inspire them. Interviewer: So you're saying, need more guidance yourself."
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,26,"Yes, and then I can teach them.. Interviewer: What do you think, to what extent were students aware of ethical guidelines for using generative AIs in their assessments?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,27,"I'm not sure if some of them they they know. I mean to me is maybe they know that they should not use it, but because maybe the life got become busy or they become lazy or for different fear at the end, they're using language model unprofessionally. So I'm not sure whether they're not aware of, or they don't have any option. Interviewer: Can you maybe also think about any strategies for that case to improve their understanding or even application of these guidelines?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,28,"I think that I should at least announce that, give them warning that if you use the language model in this way, you don't get any mark..So, but sometimes understanding that whether they are doing or not is not easy. So I think, I'm thinking that rather than going to into that path, design an assignment that there is a small room for using language model in a unethical way. I think it would be easier for me. Or if they use it, it become very clear to me, okay, this is a this is a wrong answer. So my my point is, if we can design assignment, that the generative AI is not able to solve it, then it would be very useful. Interviewer: Do you have any assignment model in mind which could.."
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,29,"I mean, for example, the assignment which we are doing in my subject mainly that, they should do as a presentation. So even if they use the language model, part of the assignment is about asking the question from them and when we are asking the question, we make sure that whether they understand or not. So the 70%, I think element of the my subject is about oral presentation. We just stop them for cheating. Interviewer: Okay. Did you encounter any ethical concerns? I think you were already mentioning some over-reliance on AI, plagiarism, misuse of AI tools."
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,30,"Yeah, again, they can do it. But again, I mean, there is no tools for us is, although it is, then it it can become…make our life is very complicated as academics. So, I saw for my last assignment when I designed, I thought, it is very authenticated but now I'm thinking that I should change it, or I should make it more diversify that, yeah, they cannot use it. So yeah, I'm thinking, yeah, I'm seeing some sign that they may use it, the generative AI in a wrong way. So I'm thinking that how can I address this problem? Interviewer: And your main approach, if I understood correctly, is to try to really get the assignments stated in a way that it's orally, and that they can't solely rely on it."
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,31,Yeah. Interviewer: Do you have any other approach in mind to prevent such.
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,32,"Again. That's the one way. Second, second is design an assignment that using generative AI doesn't help them to complete that assignments. I said, I don't know how, but I'm thinking. Interviewer: Would you also consider like a contributing some time to make sure students understand the right approach of using it or you think that's not effective like."
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,33,Sorry. What's your question again? Interviewer: Do you think it could be also a way to solve a way to solve this problem could be also to educate students?
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,34,"Yeah, but I'm not sure whether that is useful, because again when it's come to assignment, they don't care, because it's about the assignment. They get busy. They are young. I'm not sure to what really, whether they are those education can be useful. I think that we should stop and we should minimize the way they can use the generative AI in unethical fashion. Education would be nice, but I'm not sure if that's effective. Interviewer: Okay, next question aiming on the same background. How effective were the current subject guidelines, activities, and resources in promoting ethical and critical use of generative AI?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,35,"As I mentioned, we have one activity that we are explaining that how they can use generative AI in a nice way. We don't have a specific activity which explaining about the ethical use of AI. We have some lectures on unethical use of AI for general cases, but not specifically targeting students. We don't have that one. Maybe I should develop it. But again. Myself, I think that I need, I need lots of example. Otherwise it's become a bit boring tutorial, and if my tutorial is boring, it is not effective because a student doesn't learn anything. So so the point is, if the as a university, if the university can design something, I'm happy to adopt it. Interviewer: Okay, looking ahead, I think we covered already a lot of those things. But it's kind of already a sum up question looking ahead, what improvements would you suggest for integrating generative AI tools more effectively into assessments and learning activities?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,36,"Yeah as I explain if Staffs understand the niche customized application of generative AI for their field then they will be in a position to design assignment integrated with the generative AI. But I think that there is a prerequisite that themselves,1st they should have lots of good idea, and then they can design the assignment. One way is, for example, beating generative. AI, but it needs again oral presentation. For example, someone ask question from generative AI same question at the same time asking from students, they don't know. And then you compare them something like that. But yeah, it needs nice design. Interviewer: Okay, last question already, what types of resources, support or professional development would be most valuable to help you and other tutors?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,37,"What resources do you mean? Interviewer: Yeah, what resources, support, or professional development would be most valuable to help you and other tutors to teach in AI integrated subjects in the future?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,38,"What supports the question is, what support to answer resource here. Interviewer: Yeah, what types of resources, support and professional."
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,39,"Yeah, as I explained, having nice crafted, the tutorial would be very useful. Interviewer: So nice, crafted tutorial for all the teaching stuff."
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,40,Yeah. Interviewer: Anything else.
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,41,"No, no, that that's it. Interviewer: Okay, that's already the last question."
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,42,"Okay, it's all good. Then. Interviewer: Yeah, thank you so much for your time, Ortisa."
tutor,31266,Autumn,First,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,43,"Thank you, Fabian. Thank you very much."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P01,AUT-P01,1,Interviewer: Before we start the interview. Just a quick check in if it's okay. If I record this session for data analysis purposes.
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,2,"Yes. Yes. Yes. No problem. Interviewer: Beautiful Interviewer: Do you want me to give you a quick introduction? What it is about the interview, or you already quite aware of."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,3,"No, unfortunately, I received your email today, and I have some back to back classes today. I couldn't read the questions and the text. So if you can give me a brief introduction that what we will discuss today.. Interviewer: I could have sent it out earlier, but I was also very busy busy this week. So sorry for the delay in sending you the questions. So today's interview is about a UTS learning and teaching Grant that Amara and me received. And it's about shaping tomorrow's IT professionals. So it's a scaffolded approach to generative AI integration and portfolios in 1st year, bachelor of information Systems courses. And since you're a tutor for introduction to information systems. I think, Subject Coordinator-31266 as the subject coordinator. If that's right. Yeah, I think you, I think you could be like a perfect participant to just ask some general questions about how GenAI was utilized. What was good was what was bad? How can it be improved? Like some questions, some general questions, some more specific questions about current use cases, of Gen. AI, and also the subject. So it's very much related to 1st year Bachelor of information system courses as Subject Coordinator-31266 course. So that's kind of like the frame of it."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,4,"Okay. Interviewer: Okay, if you don't mind, I would just we could just start straight away diving into the 1st question."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,5,"Yeah, beautiful. Interviewer: Okay? So 1st question, what was your level of familiarity with generative AI tools? Before teaching this subject?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,6,"So yeah, I was familiar with the generative AI from when it was created. It means from the 1st days, I was familiar with the generative AI and I usually use different types of generative AI website that, for example, we have Gemini. I don't know Chatgpt. And but I more frequently use chat gpt for polishing my text email because I'm not a native speaker of English. So usually I prefer to polish. I try to write something, for example, an email, or maybe a text that I want, or even some papers, even for papers, I use ChatGPT to polish. But in some cases I feel that some changes or some sentences are not good enough. So again, I change them. So it was an interactive between me and the generative AI, that we want to polish a text or a paper or something. So I was completely familiar with the generative AI tools. Interviewer: Any other tools except ChatGPT, that you have used in the past."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,7,"Yeah, more ChatGPT. But Gemini, and also this Cpoliot as well. But I feel that I don't know. But maybe it's only if my feeling, but I think that ChatGPT is the performance better than the others. Interviewer: Okay, nice."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,8,"I also use the free version. Not I can. I have no account or something, only I use free version. Interviewer: Okay, second question. How frequently do you use generative AI tools in your professional work for teaching administration and research?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,9,"I rarely use for teaching, because usually in the teaching, I trust my understandings and my learnings, my previous learnings. So maybe in some specific case that there are some new phrases, new words, slang words that are created in and recently, maybe I and I couldn't understand that a specific word. Maybe I use ChatGPT, maybe that they can explain to the students and for the new words newest lines. But usually in the teaching I try to use my previous learnings and my the textbooks and the relevant websites. But for the research usually I try to use to, for example, if I want to write a proposal or a paper. I usually try to write myself 1st and then use ChatGPT, or other tools for polishing, or maybe some recommendations and maybe some of these parts can be done. But by some current. For example, Grammarly, I can use grammarly as well polish and edit but maybe we need some, for example, more popular words, or something that can increase them. I can say the because when the reader, when the readers want to read it. For example, a paper or proposal, it should be something clear. So maybe I use ChatGPT to make my text. I'm more clear than, for example, and before. Interviewer: And for administration purposes. Are there also use case for you?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,10,"Oh, for the administration, because I have a startup here in Australia. So, I usually have some administration tasks to do. Some of them that are related to something legal, or, for example, for tax or something like this, I usually don't use the ChatGPT. Because there are some, because I check ChatGPT for some legal and I found that they're not updated. I mean, I can say rules. And rules in that ChatGPT. So usually, I consult with the experts in the field of, for example, some administrative, but in some other, maybe maybe when I want to create my website for the business, or some, for example, content for some flyers I use ChatGPT. So for the administrative. It depends on the task and activit. I use sometimes, but I don't use in other. Interviewer: Okay, great. Thank you. Next question, prior to the subject had UTS provided you with any training, resources, or support on the ethical use of generative AI in education."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,11,"No, because, I started my casual teaching..one, I think in February 2023. So I have no special training on the using of these generative AI tools at UTS. But I believe that we should have something for that. Interviewer: Also, you don't have any resources in mind that you saw or any support given by subject coordinators."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,12,"No, no. Interviewer: What additional support or training would you like to see offered in the future?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,13,"So I think that we need some supports and training both for teachers and also students…because there are some ethical consideration which are very important, some and some judgments that usually we cannot use AI generative AI for that. And so for because of that, I think we similar to the short videos that we usually use for…I mean for training for teachers, and they should do that. If they want to be a casual teacher, they must do that if they want, we want to have some videos for also generative AI, and also the university should provide some guidelines on how teachers can check or evaluate the students in terms of using such generative AI tools, because it's also very important, because now I think different teachers have different attitudes. So as students, when go to one class, they see, for example, the teacher accept the application of the generative. The other teacher said, no, I didn't accept that one and I think also the lectures and the course coordinators should update the methods should update the contents of the courses. Maybe in some case, for example, I remember I was casual teacher at University of Sydney there, and there was a meeting for all teachers to explain how they can use generative AI how we can recommend the students to use or not use generative AI, and they also how we can update our exercises to consider this one that the students should use or should not use ChatGPT, because of that. For example, in one of the one course that I was casual teacher there in the 1st exercise that I ask a students to do an exercise with ChatGPT and one time on their own, and then compare the results to see if, for example, the output from ChatGPT is similar to the output from what they have their own research so and compare and put their comments on the ChatGPT outputs. So it may help students to know the accuracy of the ChatGPT outputs and also they can, how much they can trust on ChatGPT, and that's very important or other generative AI tools. Interviewer: Very interesting approach. Yeah. Next question. How did you integrate generative AI into your teaching or assessment feedback during this subject? Subject Coordinator-31266 subject."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,14,"As I said in the teaching I usually try not to use ChatGPT. Try to trust my understanding, my learning textbooks and the references because in some cases I have seen that the output of ChatGPT is not accurate enough. If I want to use and to teach a students there are some, maybe inaccuracies, maybe in the future, when they they make it more, they they, the generative AI train more and more…maybe they be more accurate, but I think now it's not possible, for example, to use GenAI for or other generative AI tools for teaching matter, for generating teaching materials. Or you need some very, very hard work to supervise the outputs. But I prefer not to use for teaching except for some specific words, or maybe new terms that we're entering to the science. Especially for information technology information system. Because there are the evolving, everything is evolving very fast. So maybe some new terms. New terminologies have we have in there, and we should find from somewhere. But always, if I want also to use for new terminologies. I try to use both generative AI and Google search. And then from the Google, I will connect to some website and find the definitions and then compare with ChatGPT. But if I if if I want, they can use directly from the I mean trusted websites and trusted textbooks instead of ChatGPT. But if you want to add ChatGPT, I I have put more time to compare, and if something like this for the teaching. But for the assessment, maybe I can use for the assessment in some cases, because if you want to identify how much students trust on the generative AI, maybe we can put their text in the ChatGPT, and maybe check if, for example, ChatGPT, identify, that generates such type of text or like before that. But I I've not used, but this is what that that's something that is in my mind, for example, in future I can use this one for the assessment or not, but I've never used also for assessment. Interviewer: Okay, so haven't used, you haven't used Gen. AI for teaching or assessment feedback for the subject, right?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,15,"Yeah, yeah. Interviewer: Okay, next question. In your opinion, what were the most significant challenges in incorporating Gen AI into your teaching or assessments? In this case, we can then cross this question because you're not using it."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,16,"I mentioned. But I mentioned challenges, and the main challenge is trusting the generative AI for teaching because teaching is usually from the references and textbooks, and I think in this case we cannot use GenAI, but maybe in the future, when the generative AI have some very good references or something that train more and more, so we maybe we can use for teaching. But now, I think, based on my experience, we cannot use. Interviewer: Okay, do you have any other challenges in mind except the one that you were listening?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,17,"Trust is the 1st one. No, I don't have anything in mind. Interviewer: Do you have maybe, some more specific ideas in mind how these challenges could be better addressed in future offerings?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,18,"As I mentioned, maybe for the future, we can.. if you want to use generative AI, we can compare the outputs with the references and textbooks. Or maybe we ask if, for example, we want to use for assessment, we ask students to compare the results of generative AI with what they have researched on or on their own. So maybe there are, there are some solutions that we can use for using generative AI for I mean teaching or assessment. Interviewer: Okay, next question…in your observation, did the use of generative AI tools, influence, student engagement, learning approaches or assessment, performance?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,19,"It depends. It depends on how we, how we train them to use generative. AI. It depends. If, for example, we train them for evaluating the outputs first, t and maybe prepare a report for the their evaluation of the generative AI outputs. So in long term they will find the what, what the strength of using ChatGPT and what's the weakness of using ChatGPT. And based on the these strengths and weakness they can find the best way to use generative AI for their assessment and so… Interviewer: I think this question was more aiming towards like, if you made any observations during your classes that you had for that you're teaching in Subject Coordinator-31266’s, plus where you saw maybe a positive or negative impact through generative AI in their engagement or in their learning approach, or in their assessment performance?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,20,"I have found that in some cases for some specific assessments, the outputs for many of the students are similar. So this is, I think, a negative impact…that usually all the students or many of the students use ChatGPT and then the outputs are similar. Even the keywords that they use. The positive effect is on the so I think when they use ChatGPT, the text are more clear for me, for when I read the text, for example, if they have generated report, it's more clear, especially if they polish their text. But if I have enough time then I can understand which one is only a polish, and which one is only, is a completely generated by GenAI. So about the engagement, I think they, in the in terms of engagement… ChatGPT make a student week in their engagement. So because when you want to have, even even in the class, when I ask questions from students or ask something that, for example, write something for me and email me, I found that all of them they're using ChatGPT very fast. And then, after, for example, I put, I have time, for example, 10 min, for they finish everything in 5 min, and then the other 5 min are doing something else. So it decreased the engagement level of the students. Because of that, I try to ask for some verbal and oral presentations instead of, for example, writing something in the class. So maybe in the future, also maybe ask Subject Coordinator-31266 to change, for example, the content from writing to some presentations oral presentation. The students should read something and then generate from their own words, instead of, for example…so you mean engagement and the assessment, and one other things that. Interviewer: Learning, approaches."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,21,"So I think, in the learning approaches is positive, if they try to learn from generative AI in parallel with the references and textbooks. Interviewer: Have you seen this in your classes that this happened, this positive impact."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,22,"Yes, I found that the when I asked some, or have some new terminologies for students, and then they use ChatGPT, and some of them use some other references so they can.. I mean, generate more strong for that terminology. But the students that only use ChatGPT usually have something that that is not acceptable. I think. I can say. I think I can say if they use both the generative AI and textbooks is good and even they can find their relevant textbooks from ChatGPT, and then directly get from that specific textbook learning. So it's, I think, the best way to use generative AI. And I found some of the students do this but some of them only use ChatGPT or something similar. Interviewer: Okay, nice. Thank you. Next question, while marking, did you observe whether students were able to critically, evaluate, AI generated content? Or did they tend to rely on it without verification?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,23,"It depends on the assignment but in an assignment that we need some justification, something like this. Usually, many of the students use ChatGPT, and it's very clear that they use this generative AI tools because the outputs are very similar. Or maybe maybe we ask something very broad, for example, we ask students to have some KPIs mentioned, some KPIs. So if you check, you see the KPIs, you will see that the KPIs are very similar. But few of students,  I can say few, few of them are using ChatGPT, generative AI, but they also have some corrections. Or maybe they change…get something and then change it, and then put in the assignment. Interviewer: And what strategies did you use, if any, to help them develop more evaluative judgment?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,24,"Sorry I cannot get to what you mean. Interviewer: So the 1st part of the question was if students were able to critically evaluate AI generated content. And the second part is, what strategies did you maybe use to help them develop evaluative judgment? while using generative AI."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,25,"So maybe maybe in some cases, when I it's very clear for me that they use generative AI, I can say without their own judgment, I put some comments under assignments and then ask for them for to check it again, or something, but I'm not sure if they come back and see these comments. For the cases that I'm sure that that's that's from generative AI. But for the rest, usually, I try to maybe have some only comments on the general part of the like marking criteria. I put some comments for them, but for the students that I'm sure I put the comments on the text, on the files. Interviewer: A more commons in regards to their assessments but maybe also some that you use like verbally before a tutorial or during a tutorial class."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,26,"No, usually. No, I usually don't use verbal communication., something like this with the students about generative AI… usually I put comments. Interviewer: If you think about it, what teaching strategies or interventions could better support the development of students, critical evaluation skills in future offerings?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,27,"Maybe we should…we cannot prevent students from using generative AI but maybe our strategy should be, ask students, maybe, to compare their findings based on their own knowledge, with the ChatGPT or generative AI in 1st stage and then criticize for example, the problem that we have the challenges that we have with generative AI first, and then maybe generate some solutions for that. And maybe in this process they can. We have some iterative process for different topics. For example, in the research in the assessments, there's some, for example, generating some tables. Everything that we want, then compare, and then they in the long term, I think they can understand what's the strength and what's the weakness of the generative AI and then they can use better application of that generative AI, based on their understanding of the weakness and the strengths. Interviewer: Could you also maybe think of any resources that could be provided to students to improve their critical evaluation skills?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,28,"Maybe we can find some audio or videos or even texts that shared their similar understandings of generative AI challenges, risks and the mitigations for these risks. Maybe, share with the students this text or video or audios or everything with them. And then after that we can have some practical practices with them. Interviewer: Thank you. To what extent were students aware of ethical guidelines for using generative AI in their assessments?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,29,"Yeah, I'm not sure they're aware about, because usually I have never seen that any students, for example, mention or acknowledge using generative AI. But maybe it is because we don't want from them. So maybe if we ask the students to acknowledge or explain how they use generative AI in this assessment, then maybe they canput some text. But I prefer that we put something in our assessment, for example, a part or section that students, for example, acknowledge about the application of generative AI tools and explain how they use and how make benefits from the generative AI. But now I think because we don't want from them. They'll also think that it's not necessary. So this is one very, very important challenge that we should solve with ethical consideration. And I don't know. Maybe maybe we should ask a students. And also we have a tool that check the assignments that if it's generated because I know that there are something that is I can say something that that is in only in our mind. For example, if if I go through a text, and I found some specific words or some specific writings. I can understand that this is not from a student that's from generative. AI. So, but if we have a tool, because, as you, as we have some tools and some software that check, for example, a paper and found how much is similar to the other papers…maybe we have a tool that can check with an assessment and then see how much is similar to the output of the generative AI tools, and then…but I think in the future we will have such tools as well. Interviewer: Yeah, I think it's a good strategy, clear communication to improve their understanding and application of these guidelines instead of or accept communication. Do you have any other strategy in mind that could improve their understanding and application of ethical guidelines?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,30,"Ethical guidelines and using generative AI, you mean? I think we should ask them to mention everything about how they use generative for each assessment. So we have one part specific that they explain how they use generative AI for this assessment. Interviewer: Okay. Did you encounter any ethical concerns for example, over reliance on AI plagiarism or misuse of AI tools?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,31,"I have concerns for all of these. I think it's all of them are concerns over-reliance is one very serious concern… Interviewer: I think the question is more like if you encountered in your classes any ethical concern like over reliance on AI, plagiarism, misuse of AI tools…"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,32,While marking? Interviewer: Maybe.
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,33,"In marking or in the assessment? Interviewer: Yeah in the assessment, or maybe even during your tutorials?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,34,"Yeah. As I said this, this is, these are my concerns about the over reliance of the students on the output of ChatGPT, but I because…we have too many students, we cannot focus on that. See if we have something automatically check this challenges… it's very good, but I know that these are the challenges, but I have not ever encounters, because I'm not focusing on the and outputs. Interviewer: What do you think, how could the subject better address or prevent such issues? In the future?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,35,"Maybe we should think of some solutions, some approaches similar to what I mentioned about the comparison of the outputs. So maybe we ask students have one part for the outputs of generative AI, one output of their own, and maybe finally, one output of combination of both. So so, I think this was this was, this can be a can not say long term, but short term for that. But in the long term. I I'm sure that we, we will have some tools that check the text and will tell us how much is it generated by generative AI tool.. But we should think of some solutions like this comparison, but maybe based on the type, the assignment, and the questions that we have in the assessment or the exercise, then we can have some other solutions. Or maybe ask a students or change the exercise, make personalize, make the exercise very, very, I mean specific for students, and with some numeric, but it's not possible for all courses. Interviewer: You were also mentioning maybe more oral activities, if I understood correct.."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,36,"Yeah, oral activities also can be another solution that you can students ask the students to generate something and present in the class. So they maybe use generative AI for generation. But they they when they want to and talk about so they should talk about from their understanding of that text. Interviewer: Okay, next question, how effective were the current subject guidelines, scaffolding activities and resources in promoting, ethical and critical use of GenAI?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,37,"So unfortunately for this course that I'm as a casual, casual teacher, this is not effective at all. So maybe we need to revise… everything in the course, especially the assignments. If you want to make it ethical, maybe we ask students for all assignments to mention the role of generative AI in their outputs and results. I mean this is the 1st step. Interviewer: Do you have an example for ineffective scaffolding activities in that subject?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,38,"So for example, in this topic, we ask students to explain how some specific tools like Chatbot lot, Google trends or scatterplots, or everything is used for one specific business. So I I know that the students usually put in the generative AI ask to explain the examples and then they use those examples in their text in their output. Even we have some number of limitation limitation in the number of words but they use generative AI. But maybe if we ask students to bring some, for example, if they use, for example, a scatter plot, or they use pivot table or Chatbot…they bring some samples in their report. For example, some. if you use some specific business, so find some data with a specific source, put their source. For example, if I use this company Amazon. So I get this data from this web source, and then I generate some pivot table for that. That this pivot table answer these questions. Maybe if ask a student to put the references and sources for all teams in they, it can help to maybe ask them to make use of generativeAI, more efficiently more ethical. Interviewer: I know you said, it's mostly ineffective, but maybe you can think of like a single thing that was effective in the current subject guidelines, activities and resources in promoting ethical and critical use of generative AI?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,39,"I mean, the course is very interesting and good, but in terms of using generative AI, I think we can do something that make it more effective than what's the current state. I mean, I mean we need something to do because we should revise everything right. If we want to use generative AI. Interviewer: Do you maybe have an example how to improve subject guidelines, or resources."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,40,"If you want to add subject, guideline is okay. But for the assignments, I mean that we should revise everything. Interviewer: Okay."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,41,"But maybe maybe we have 1 week, we assign one week for training students about generative AI, the challenges and the risk. Maybe for the course guideline, I think we can have one week for the generative AI application. But for the assignment we should revise the content of the assignment. Interviewer: Maybe also the format, or only the content?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,42,"Even the format of also…maybe put all for all assignment, we put one section for the how we they use generative AI for this specific assignment. Maybe they say no use, or maybe they explain. Interviewer: Okay, next question…Looking ahead, what improvements would you suggest for integrating generative AI tools more effectively into assessments and learning activities? kind of like a summary question. I know you were mentioning already some parts of it, but maybe for it's a second last question just to revisit some of those ideas again. So, looking ahead, what improvements would you suggest for integrating generative AI tools more effectively into assessments and learning activities?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,43,"As you said, that I mentioned some, some of them like, for example, comparison, or ask a student some oral presentation instead of some writing assessment. And maybe…I don't know. Maybe we can ask students to if they use generative AI ask students to put their outputs, and how they communicate with generative AI inside their exercise. Even even the questions and all the prompts and the outputs, maybe as a file attached to the assignment. So maybe we can find, for example, how they communicate with the generative AI to find the answers and this this can be changed. We should change the assignments, and they can upload the also their communication with the generative AI in the assignment as well. And then one page maybe they explain the challenges of working with generative AI for this specific assignment. Interviewer: Okay, then, we're already at the very end. Last question…what types of resources, support or professional development, would be, most valuable to help you as a tutor confidentially teach in AI integrated subjects in the future? So what are the resources, support, or professional development that you think would be valuable to help you as a tutor to teach in an AI integrated subject in the future?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,44,"In terms of you mean generative AI, or is it general about AI? Interviewer: It's about teaching in the context of a subject that is allowing AI being used. In that context, what types of resources, support, or professional development, provided maybe by university, would be valuable for you, or help you to teach in those subjects."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,45,"Maybe if we have some shared space. I mean virtual share the space that we can, for example, see the process that the students work, for example, with a specific data and then they can share with us their pro, their their… I can say…how they use this specific software that they use this data for analysis using AI for analysis, this data. And then we can see this process as if video maybe and it can help us to see how they deal with that specific data, and where they start, where they end… and we check the process that they have. So they, instead of, for example, submit submitting or uploading their final results…we can find also see the process they use to analyze this data. It will help us to check this process instead of only the outputs and the results. So this, this is, this is this virtual, maybe, or as a cloud that can help us, for example. But I'm not sure if, for example, the capacity, and for all the students possible or not. Or even, I think, for the AI… Interviewer: Do you think like similar to a tutor induction training, a professional development for tutors could be also helpful in terms of how to utilize generative AI in a positive in those subjects?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,46,"Yes, yes, yes, I think we should have some classes for tutors. So I I think we don't have any teacher now for that. But I think in near future we will have also some teachers. Because I think because it's a very evolving technology. It's very emerging. It's very changing every day. So there is no one that can focus and find something is you're thinking about something, you see, though, that that's changed. So because of that, maybe we don't have any specific references. But but we, I think we need even even we need some discussion between tutors to find …to share our experiences with other tutors, maybe…and then maybe from this experience, we can find something that we can use in our class. Because maybe we cannot, as I said, we cannot find a specific teacher that stay here in the class and explain how we can use generative AI. But when we discuss together all tutors, teachers, lecturers here, then we can maybe have some solutions for something that maybe we can generate a manual something that we can, how we can use generative AI, and then share with other tutors. But because it is, this topic is something that's evolving, so it's very difficult to have some… Static teaching methods or something, learning…we should have something dynamic change in the materials and the references. Interviewer: I think that's a good point that you make. Also the concept, if I understood it correct, having a platform just solely centred around generative AI providing resources and aligning tutors and maybe even subject coordinators in a way that it's really effective in teaching in this new environment of AI…if I understood correct correctly this this approach."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,47,"Yes, yes. Interviewer: Think that could be an interesting approach. Yes, Interviewer: But even like maybe some resources that you would like to see, some guidelines, some information papers, some…"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Second,tutor,AUT-P02,AUT-P02,48,"I'm not sure if we have some guidelines for that, but maybe we can have some place, somewhere, that is, teachers and the tutors share their experience, and in the long term these experiences can be, we can make it…I can say, change it to a guideline. But there is no guideline that we can say. For example, if you read this guideline, you will take everything…but it comes from the experience of the and also course by course, is different. For example, in the social science, maybe there are some experiences that's not very applicable in the engineering context. So in the engineering, we have some experiences that's not applicable for others... But if we put all the concepts, all the experience and the learnings from the generative AI in one place, and then we can work on that, and maybe we can in the long term we can change it to a guideline. Or maybe we can change it to a very short presentation file or video that maybe we can see and get all the experience in different fields about using generative AI. Interviewer: Okay, okay, thank you so much."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,1,So I'm happy to help you in this project? What is it about. Interviewer: Has Motaza talked to you a bit about the project.
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,2,"Not yet. Interviewer: Okay, it's based on a research grant that we got for generative AI, and it's basically investigating how subjects could be supported through Gen AI resources for students and also for tutors. To see like, what's the current state. And we're also working. Or we finished actually, now, working on a student and a tutor resource. And in the next semester we're gonna try to bring them into a subject as well and see how it will change the experience. It started all based on a subject that I was tutoring last semester where I saw, like a lack of information for tutors as well as for students in how to utilize generative AI and yeah, based on this, we applied for the research grant and we got this research grant. And yeah."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,3,"Yeah, because we have something similar in CSIR. Interviewer: Yeah, I prepared some questions for today. But before we start, I just want to make sure that it's okay for you that this session is recorded for data analysis purposes."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,4,"Yep. Interviewer: Yeah, okay, great and you feel good. You're ready to go. Your your mental capacity is almost there."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,5,"Yeah. Interviewer: Okay.. Then I will just start straight away with the questions that we prepare. Well, the 1st question is, what was your level of familiarity with generative AI tools before teaching this subject."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,6,"So are you talking about specific subject, or generally. Interviewer: BIS, the one that you're doing with Subject Coordinator-31266."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,7,"Okay, so what is your question then? Interviewer: What was your level of familiarity with generative AI tools before teaching the subject."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,8,Oh! Interviewer: Maybe.
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,9,"It was good. Not expert user but a general user but a general user of GenAI like I used it, and sometimes I use it to understand, maybe, how the students are using it. So it's kind of, yeah…it's sometimes I get, try to get some answers from ChatGPT or Gen AI to understand the questions… if maybe the students give us the same answers or not, you know, just to have some idea. Interviewer: Okay, so basically the tool that you're using is mostly ChatGPT? or do you have any other specific tools that you use?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,10,"The Copilot, we used it here this year in the subject and in the one of the tutorials, in in information systems. Interviewer: Okay, how frequently do you use Gen AI tools in your professional work teaching, administration, research?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,11,"Sometimes. Yeah, for grammar corrections. Yeah, for grammar corrections, or to get some new ideas for the assignments. Interviewer: Would you say it's like weekly or.."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,12,"And yeah, weekly, we can say weekly. So sometimes the Gen. AI can give us a good ideas or scenarios, for example, I encourage a student to hey, you have a presentations, and if you don't know where to start, how to start, you may get help from Gen AI to generate some scenario for you, and that scenario can be used for your presentations…so something like that. Interviewer: Next question, prior to the subject, had UTS provided you with any training, resources, or support on the ethical use of generative AI in education?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,13,"Minimum, or if it was, it was very general…not not specifically for the school, or you know it was just a general. Interviewer: Do you have any resource in mind?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,14,"Oh, it was something you mentioned in the library, they call it research master or Research AI, something like that. So they encourage students to use that to generate or to create some literature review by 5 resources. So if you go to the library and ask that research master, it can gives you the top 5 resources for that specific topic you're asking for. So, for example, I use that once or 2 time…that was mentioned in one of the workshops but held by the library. I think I'm not sure, but I think it was on the library. Interviewer: Okay. Great is there any additional support or training that you would like to see that could be offered in the future?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,15,"Yes, definitely, especially in the prompting. Because since last year, I mean, there are a lot of new things coming up, and as a tutor or as a subject coordinator, we need to understand what are the differences between all these Gen AI, Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini, and etc. There are a lot of and deep sick. So there are a lot of Gen I models and we need to understand what are the differences which one can be used which one cannot be used. What are the restrictions? You know? Interviewer: Great. Thank you. Next question. Interviewer: how did you… I know you already talked a bit about it, but maybe you can mention it again. How did you integrate Gen AI in your teach into your teaching or assessment feedback during the subject?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,16,"I integrated… I give them, okay, there are 2 things. I used it. I tested last year to generate one case study, a real case study. Oh, so I generated some case studies based on the Gen AI, and ask the student to think about it and give them the time like 20 min or half an hour to answer the questions based on the case study and then to create some slides on presentations. So I used it, and the students also use it in the class. So you know, nowadays we have the tutorials in the class, most of the students they use Gen I when they want to answer or respond to the questions. So there, I can see when I go around the desks, they use GenAI. But that's fine, because that's help them to understand what's happening and then I can get some answers, different answers from them, and then we shape the whole idea. So it was not bad, you know. It's a good tool. Yeah. Interviewer: Okay, and for assessment feedback, did you also use it or utilize it?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,17,For assessment and feedback. For assessments not really. Just for shaping the shaping the structure of the feedback. You know. Interviewer: Okay.
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,18,"Just the shaping…I know some tutors… I realized that some tutors last year they used it by directly, for example, they give the assignment to the GenAI .. Then I told them, don't do it at all. Because I can see the...you know you always when you get the response from Chat GPT, that gives you 200 300 words, a lot for the student, that cannot be a feedback that not cannot be a point to point feedback. So I just use it to structure my feedback, not for giving feedback. Interviewer: More for language purposes, or like for clarity purposes."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,19,"Exactly. To make it nicely, you know, to shape it very nicely with, you know, yeah. Interviewer: I think that's a that's a good use case for sure. Yeah. In your opinion, what were the most significant challenges in incorporating Gen. AI into your teaching or assessments. You mentioned already the feedback part for other tutors."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,20,"Which aspect is challenging? Interviewer: Yeah, the most significant challenges in incorporating Gen AI into your teaching or assessments?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,21,"I think we need to monitor it. But, for example, we have final exam in one of the subjects, not in Subject Coordinator-31266 subject, in other subject…when we have final exam, and it's open case exam, most of the students they use GenAI without any monitoring. And that it is obvious, you know, I can see that is ChatGPT, so there should be a solution for this you know. My solution is different from other solutions. Maybe we can conduct it on a paper based instead of online. Paper based question answer exams, or there are some tools, I think AI monitoring or something. I've never used it, but I've heard from my colleagues, they said, is not very useful. Interviewer: Okay, next question. In your observation, did the use of Gen. AI tools influence, student engagement, learning approaches or assessment performance?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,22,Yes. Interviewer: Both positive and negative. Maybe examples for both.
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,23,"Oh, for the in-class engagement, I think it's positive. For in class engagement is positive, because it's kind of tool to help them and to initiate some ideas for the students. So it's good. For the assignments it's also good. It can gives them some hints, you know. So if they use it wisely if they can use it for background research that's obviously a good option. But for my for my assignments, which, when I was a subject coordinator. I don't ask the student just to give the answers by in a text format. No, I asked them to generate some figures, some diagrams. So you so you spend not more time on what has been created by ChatGPT, because ChatGPT cannot create you a perfect diagram or chart or something like that. Yeah, even if it can be done as a tutor or as a marker, I can understand that that was created by ChatGPT a diagram or charts, you know. So it's kind of integrating the text with diagrams, figures, you know to increase the engagement. Interviewer: And in terms of learning approaches of your students. Have you seen any positive or negative impact?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,24,"Oh, positive, yeah, positive especially when we have open cases study like we give them the freedom to choose any case study, and they can go and search some topics, they can get help and ideas from the ChatGPT, and then sometimes they really have a good ideas. So yes, it has a good and positive impact."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,25,Yes. Interviewer: Do you have maybe an example of a negative impact for assessment performance or not really.
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,26,"For the assessment performance…I just mentioned about the final exam that are done online without any AI monitoring. I have issue with those kinds of exams. So I think it's negative impact. Because when I do the marking, obviously, when it's ChatGPT, I realize, see, there is no evidence. Nobody will tell you that this is ChatGPT, but all the answers are similar. And yeah, so it has a bad and negative impact. Yeah, especially when you compare the performance of the student. You have the performance of the student during the, you know 12 weeks they got 0 in quiz one and they got one in quiz 2 so suddenly, they give you 100% perfect answers. So what is that? How you can translate this? There is not an direct evidence, but it's just indication. Interviewer: Great point. Okay, let's move on to the next question. While marking, did you observe whether students were able to critically evaluate AI generated, or did they tend to rely on it without verification?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,27,"That's a really good question. In my subject I will ask the student to critically mention how it was used, but unfortunately, so far I did not see any subjects that they ask the student to critically think or mention how ChatGPT or Gen AI was used. So this is one of the lacking issues in the current subjects. Yeah. So I think we need to integrate a part to the exams that how ChatGPTwas used. Critically they need to mention it. Critic. They provide a critic…why they use it, critic like critically they need to mention how they use it, why did use it? On which part which part they didn't? which one they decided to select in the exam and which one which part did not select something like that. Because when you get answer from ChatGPT, you get a lot of answers and options…so why the student select those kind of answers that is really important to ask the student to provide something critically about this and maybe we can put this part in the end of the exam, you know, and it can have 5% or 10% of the exam. Interviewer: Okay, you were mentioning that you tried to emphasize this to your students. Did you have any strategy to help them develop evaluative judgment?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,28,"I don't have a direct strategy, but the strategy is, I would like to…if, let's say, if the exam has 30% of the mark. I would allocate 10% of those 30% to a critic. Gen AI critic. That means how Gen AI was was used in this exam. How it was used, and in which way, you know… this kind of reflection. So add a reflection to the to the exam reflection about  GenAI. Interviewer: Okay. Nice."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,29,"But currently, currently, we just ask the student, hey, if you use Gen AI, please acknowledge it. This is a very general sentence, and nobody do it. But if we clearly ask the student to provide a section that how ChatGPT or GenAI was used in this exam it would be very beneficial, I think. Interviewer: Yeah, that's a good point. Okay, next question, to what extent were students aware of the ethical guidelines for using Gen. AI in their assessments?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,30,"In my subject I introduce the ethics, and I mean the the … you know the Gen AI how to be used, what are the rules. I guide them to the website which is announced by UTS. So I set my expectations from them in the beginning and from the 1st tutorial and yeah, and then it's their turn. So if something happens later, then obviously I will deduct mark, or there will be a problematic, you know. So the best strategy for me is just to set up everything about GenAI in the beginning. And I prepare some slides, and I explain everything about the you know Gen AI, the conduct, yeah. Interviewer: Do you think it was fruitful? So like students, they understood majority of the students or."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,31,"Yes, yes, some of them they are familiar, some of them they are not familiar, especially if they are 1st year students who are coming from overseas. That's why it's really important to brief them about Gen AI in the beginning. So most of the time they understand what's happening, because I warn them. It's not. It is a friendly, but it's kind of warning, you know. Don't do it otherwise you'll get 0 easy. Interviewer: What strategies could improve their understanding and application of these guidelines? Even further, what do you think."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,32,What applications? Interviewer: What strategies could improve their understanding and application of these existing guidelines?
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,33,"Oh, I think I think if each subject coordinator, or tutor shared their… especially the tutors, not the subject coordinators they, because they are responsible for the marking. If they share their observations with the subject coordinators or with the faculty, and then we are gathering a lot of data from everybody, then it would be great. So that's kind of strategy. Gather the data first. I don't have a strategy yet. I just want to see what's happening first. Interviewer: Okay."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,34,"And then we can make decision based on the data we've gathered. Interviewer: Right. Next question, did you encounter any ethical concerns? For example, over reliance on AI, plagiarism, misuse of AI tools."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,35,"Yes, and I awarded 0."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,36,"Because, okay, it was 2 years ago, I think and that happens, I believe, because I was not the subject coordinator, but because the expectation were not correctly introduced by the subject coordinator, or by this the faculty. That's why the student didn't know. They told me we didn't know we just came from overseas. Blah blah blah. But that is not valid. So yeah. So unfortunately, that student missed the mark for that assignment, so they feel they face the consequences. But I think later the subject coordinator or the school they gave them another opportunity. I'm not sure what happens later. I just reported. Yes, yes. Because we need to report what's happening to the subject coordinator, and then they rise it up to to the school, or whatever who is responsible to provide solution for this. Interviewer: And what do you think? How could the subject better address or prevent such issues in the future of over reliance on AI plagiarism? Misuse of AI."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,37,"It's the subject coordinator and the student centre responsibility to introduce, to make everything clear from the beginning and maybe we can initiate a new training, short course training in the canvas. So the student can do it, and they get a certificate that they have done this certificate regarding the Gen AI. So they understand the requirements, you know. Interviewer: So from the very beginning, you would say, just check on all the students, and make clear to all the students what are the expectations, and what are the restrictions."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,38,"Exactly exactly and the the subject coordinator can put this information in a special page in canvas. Some of them they didn’t, some of them, they are doing it so there is no consistency, I think. Interviewer: Thinking about Subject Coordinator-31266s subject, how effective were the current subject guidelines, scaffolding activities and resources in promoting, ethical and critical use of Gen AI?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,39,"Well, Subject Coordinator-31266’s subject is kind of introductory subject. So student, they have no idea about ethics, about …because they are 1st year student. Soin, I mean, we request the student to use Gen AI in some part of the activities or assignments. But I mean, it's everything clear, I think in what is our subject…Because, yeah, everything is clear. So yeah, I have no idea about the new updates, because I do the tutoring. He is doing the lecturing. So maybe, he added, some points, you know, in his lectures. Interviewer: Do you have maybe an example for an effective scaffolding approach or subject guideline that he's using in promoting the ethical and critical use of Gen AI?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,40,"Just can't mention or put the what is what is important in the 1st lecture, you know. Just to brief the student about what's happening. What are the consequences of using GenAI…okay, that's pretty much. You can see. Interviewer: That's what Subject Coordinator-31266 did in his subject?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,41,"I'm not too sure, because, see the lectures are online. So sometimes I'm not watching the lectures, so he may say something. He may not say something about this, so I cannot give you exact answer about this. Interviewer: Okay."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,42,"Yeah, because sometimes we just watch, we see the slides…not the online lectures, you know. Interviewer: Yeah, I understand. Okay, second last question, we're almost there. Thank you for your time. Looking ahead, what improvements would you suggest for integrating Gen. AI tools more effectively into assessments and learning activities?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,43,"I think I answered this question by adding the 1st thing we can…we can assign 20 or 30 percentage of the assignments using Gen. AI, that's fine. And when they use Gen AI, we need to allocate 10% mark for providing a reflection how Gen. AI was used. What was the benefit? What was the disbenefit? Why did you come up with a solution? Etc. And one this is one number one, number 2…if the if the assignment has some.. if it's a report base and the student, we know that they can use Gen AI…it's good if we can ask students to generate or provide some drafts, tables like diagrams based on that…the analysis. So what I mean, we request them to do some small analysis, not just writing text, you know, because getting text from ChatGPT is easy, but making or doing some analysis it's a bit more difficult and time consuming. So maybe we can ask the student to do some analysis, not only report, you know, not only text. Interviewer: Yep, that's a great point, because I think that really necessitates for students to understand what generative AI is outputting."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,44,"Exactly exactly so, maybe comparative case studies. That means they have some case studies, and they need to compare it. And based on that comparison they need to generate some figures, diagrams, or whatsoever. It's like business analytics, you know. Interviewer: Alright last question, even though you gave also, like partially answers to this one already, just to summarize the whole interview. What types of resources, support, or professional development would be most valuable to help you as a tutor to teach in AI integrated subjects in the future?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,45,"I think the first…the most important thing is that we know that the student they're using Gen AI, especially the paid one, not the free version, the paid one, which are more professional. So if you want to understand what's happening. I think the University should provide us with the paid version of ChatGPT or Gen AI. Because they are more professional. And we need to understand, for example, if a student generate a figure from ChatGPT some subject coordinators, they don't know. They don't know that ChatGPT is able to do that, and they can put it in their assignment. But if you yourself as a tutor or subject coordinator, you have that option that you ask the ChatGPT to give you…I mean to run the or to do the assignment one time using ChatGPT to understand what's happening, you know, to understand the students answer as well. So I think it's a good idea if the university can provide us with the paid version of ChatGPT orGenAI Because we need to we need to walk in the same time simultaneously with the student. The student cannot be, they shouldn't be upfront of us, you know. Cause I realized this last year some student, they use some figures created by ChatGPT and they put it in their assignments. I could catch that catch this. But the subject coordinators and others they couldn't, they couldn't imagine that ChatGPT can be used directly in the figures. So that's why yeah, it's a good idea. But at that time I think, yeah, yeah, I use the professional version. I wanted to see what's happening. But you know it's paid. Interviewer: Except like paying tutors and academics for a premium version of ChatGPT would you also like to see some kind of like training or teaching stuff like more support or resources?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,46,"Yes, definitely, definitely, because I can see many people are using it and we need to understand how it can be used efficiently and wisely. Yes, yeah. I rarely receive emails regarding how it can be used, how…all what we receive is just general, you know, general. Even if a small workshop could be beneficial. You know. I've never seen. Yeah, I've never have received any any workshop from the school or faculty regarding this. Interviewer: So you feel like the resources that exist are not specific enough at the moment that are provided to you as a teaching staff."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,47,"Yes, exactly. Yes. Because when the students are using it. So we also need to understand how wesing…how to use it right. Interviewer: Okay."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,48,"Yeah, pretty. Interviewer: Nice. Interviewer: I think we are at the end. That was."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,49,"By the way, the answers which I provided are general, not not very specifically to Subject Coordinator-31266’s subject, because I I'm subject coordinator, tutor, and lecturer of other subjects as well. So my answers were even more broad, you know. Interviewer: Yeah, I understood, which is not necessarily a bad thing for us, I think it's good that we have like those insights."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,50,"I tried to give you my answers, based on my observations from the classes, from lecture, from subject coordinator, it was from everything. Interviewer: Okay, then I have one last question that is, off script… Comparing Subject Coordinator-31266’s subject to the other subjects that you also used to explain some of your ideas for the questions that I had. Do you feel like Subject Coordinator-31266’s subject is doing well in terms of implementing generative AI in a healthy and supportive way for students compared to other subjects that you have seen and teached or taught?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,51,"Yes, yes, Subject Coordinator-31266’s subject is good and advance. It's kind of upfront, I mean, really, compared to other subjects. Yes. Yeah, because I told you, we use, we ask, we have some activities. They are specifically related to Gen AI, and we started this, not this semester. We started this 3 semester ago, or maybe 2 years ago when the 1st Gen AI. Was introduced. The next semester, we asked the students, for example, to use Gen AI, how it can be used, you know, to get some ideas."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P03,AUT-P03,52,"So, yeah, what does a subject is good in this term? In this sense. Interviewer: Yeah. Okay, then, thank you so much for your time. 31266 Autmn – Fourth Tutor Interview Interviewer: Do you mind if I record this session for analysis purposes?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,53,"That's fine! Interviewer: Yeah, beautiful, nice. 1st of all. Thank you so much for your time. I know it's quite stressful right now, with all the assignments and marketing. So I really appreciate it. Do you kind of understand what this interview is about? Or should I just give a quick."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,54,"Tell me about it. I'm not quite sure yet, but. Interviewer: So Amara and myself are working on a FFYE research grant, and the title of the Grant is shaping tomorrow's It professionals a scaffolded approach to Gen AI integration and portfolios in 1st year, Bachelor of Information Systems courses. And since you're tutoring Subject Coordinator-31266’s course, which is a BIS subject for 1st year bachelor students, it's clearly connected to that. And your course actually was one of the 1st courses. That is part of this research grant in terms of analyzing certain student behavior in regards to GenAI usage. Because we're working currently, or we finished working on a student resource for that, and also on a lecturer or subject coordinator and tutor resource."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,55,Okay. Interviewer: And today's interview is just a general check on Gen AI in the context of the subject that you tutored this semester.
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,56,Okay. Interviewer: Yeah.
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,57,"I'm happy to help in. Yeah. Interviewer: Nice, beautiful. Okay, then, let's just not waste any time and start straight away with the interview questions that I sent to you. If you want, you can open them at the same time, or, if you prefer, I can also always just copy and paste the question into the chat. What do you prefer?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,58,"So what questions you mean? The consent, form. Interviewer: The consent form and the 12 questions. So we're just going to go through each of them now."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,59,"Alright. Cool. Yeah. Interviewer: Yeah, okay."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,60,"I think gotten them, yet. Interviewer: Nice. So the 1st question is, what was your level of familiarity with generative AI tools before teaching this subject.?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,61,"You mean when before teaching this subject? Because I've been teaching this subject for I guess a few years. So what do you mean by before? Because, yeah, I'm not sure at what point of time you're talking about. Because, yeah, I kind of like knew some somehow about GenAI. But I'm not sure if I have, I know too much about it. But yeah, I mean, I was familiar, perhaps, but I'm not sure which point of time, to be honest, because I can't really remember even when I started information systems. But yeah, perhaps to some to some degrees I was familiar with it. Yeah. Interviewer: Maybe even just before this semester. So maybe you could briefly describe specific tools you knew or used."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,62,"For Gen AI? Yeah, well, I mean, like, GenAI I mostly use well, I mean, I am familiar with ChatGPT. I I like it. I still use it myself. So and that's for mostly what I meant for different purposes, like in my personal life, but also academic life. I actually would like to sort of like use. ChatGPT, because, that really simplifies everything. Gives you great ideas and and whatnot. So, yeah. Interviewer: Okay…And how frequently do you use Gen AI tools in your professional work for teaching, administration or even research?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,63,"Well, it again, it depends, I mean, where it needs be. But maybe, like perhaps I use it at least once a week or twice, if not more. Interviewer: For teaching, for administration, for research? What are the purposes that you're using it for."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,64,"For administration. What do you mean by administration like in which ways? Interviewer: Administration can be maybe helping you prepare email correspondences, or just some.."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,65,"For for that. But yeah, I mean, as I said, like…perhaps for teaching. I've used it a few times altogether, just like maybe just to get some ideas about, oh, how to make this more fun, or like, more creative ways to sort of perhaps deliver, the lesson for that session. Yeah, I mean, I use that not many, not a lot of times but I've used it a few times overall, not only for information systems, but yeah. Interviewer: Okay and for research, do you also use it for some of your research."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,66,"For research. Yeah, I do sometimes. But as you, we both know well. You always need to really double check when you use AI, because it's not 100% reliable. And I wouldn't just follow what it says if it's for research purposes. So I always prefer to double check myself if I have done that. If I do that. Yeah. Interviewer: Okay. Next question. Prior to the subject. I know you were saying you taught it already for a couple of years. But maybe prior to this semester. Can you remember, remember any resources, training, or support on ethical use of Gen AI that UTS provided?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,67,"Maybe I can't really recall to be honest. But maybe if there were some let me think. GenAI trainings, and I remember there was a 1 day conference which I attended last year, if I'm not mistaken a year ago or 2 years ago. But the whole purpose was around Gen AI, how to teach it, how to deal with students using Gen AI and strategies and whatnot, maybe more than one year ago. But that was perhaps the most sort of let's say, organized way of UTS training, or allowing..us to be able to sort of like, look at different aspects of GenAI, like where it was like I mean, a lot of people they were, you know that it has been always a concern, and still is, I believe, when it comes to students doing assessments task and using Gen AI because well, at the start we were very cautious about it, and everybody would just kind of like freaked out. But now I guess, like we know a lot more about it. That, and I knew from the beginning that I thought, this is an amazing tool and why not actually for learning purposes as well? And this was what also was discussed during that one day conference that it can be a very powerful tool for educational purposes. But we always try to actually remind the students, or I have always done that, that, hey, it's a good tool, why not.. I'm using it as well, but use it, but not for writing up your research. Don't rely on it 100%, and if you do it, if you use it, then you need to be aware of your academic integrity and the fact that you cannot copy paste ideas, but always can be besides, you to help you to assist you in understanding and different concepts and aspects. Interviewer: Okay. So only this one conference that happened is something that you could recall that UTS provided."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,68,"I mean Fabian, to be honest, I can't really..I mean I'm not, perhaps good at recalling what exactly I've done. I mean, if I look at what sort of if there were any trainings or whatnot online, maybe I have done but I can't really tell you for sure whether that has been the case or not, so I don't want to give you wrong information. But yeah, as far as as much as I remember, there have, there has been actually some, I guess online trainings like for maybe half an hour, 10 min. But I can't really remember exactly what they were. But I've done like every year. I'm doing some trainings, basically at UTS, which are kind of online. Yeah. Interviewer: Okay, is there any additional support or training that you would like to see being offered in the future around this context?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,69,"If yeah, I believe there's still a lot that can be unfold. And we can learn from it and about it. But specifically well in terms of awareness, I guess we've been given enough sort of like about the AI and whatnot when it comes to teaching and assessments. Because I also work at UNSW, so we've had some sort of trainings and meetings and sessions around AI there as well. Maybe more than UTS, definitely. And we're using even a mentor AI for students to actually assist them with their. And it's kind of like they're still working on it. But for training purposes, yeah, I mean, I guess that would be that can be helpful. I'm not sure to what degree and how much? Because I guess, pretty like from my understanding, I guess, yeah, I know that there's so many different AI tools available for different… Perhaps it would be beneficial if you can know all right. So what is available like in sense in a form of training, maybe I don't see any harm in that, and definitely can be useful. Yeah. Interviewer: okay, nice. How did you integrate generative AI, so far into your teaching or assessment feedback during this subject that you tutored for Subject Coordinator-31266?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,70,"For this particular subject…not much, really for for feedback purposes, because I mean the assessment task that we've had for Subject Coordinator-31266. I mean, I haven't used it. This it was mostly into graphic presentations and stuff which, yeah, I hardly use GenAI for those purposes. Interviewer: And for other subjects, maybe."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,71,Like how much I have used it to for assistance? Interviewer: How did you integrate it? So in in what way did you integrate generative AI in your teaching or assessment feedback..
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,72,"So I think I've already mentioned that in terms of teaching I have perhaps, like"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,73,"use, GenAI, to give me some ideas a few times. How to sort of unfold or like how to make this more fun or understandable whatever…Definitely for ideas. Yeah, that's that can be very useful. But I'm not sure if I have, when I got the feedback from GenAI, I was, I successfully sort of like applied whatever I got from Gen AI in terms of teaching. But I've I've seen, not for this particular subject, but for other subjects. I actually, I remember once I… it was more sort of like uvc course. But then I asked, if for example, this concept, how can I make it more fun? And it came up with a very great like I mean great scaffolding and what not, which I ended up not using it, because then I felt like, Aal right, so it needs this and that whatnot. But it was just like I was, I really liked it. I felt like, wow, that is, that is really good. If you can incorporate these ideas and whatnot. But the problem is, if you have done something so many times before, like, I guess yeah, I always would welcome new ideas for sure. And then that is very interesting, because I always want to make sure that my classes are sort of useful to the students and also not boring because you don't want to actually sort of like run a class or teach a class where students, they lose interest very quickly and get bored. So that has always been a high priority for me. And so definitely, GenAI can help, for with that and for assessment purposes…yes, there has been, instances where, for example there was a particular response that I actually consulted the GenAI, like ChatGPT, and say, hey, what do you think about this one, or but then, as I said, you always, I always have to double check with what it produces. So it's really good for that in that sense. But I guess, like you've you know about the AI hallucination or whatnot ChatGPT, for example. So you don't want to really get involved, or, you know, be part of that, because that is gonna be embarrassing. So yeah. Interviewer: Okay, that's a good bridge to our next question.. What were the most significant challenges in incorporating generative AI into your teaching or assessments, apart from hallucination which you already refered to."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,74,"No, I don't really see any challenges to be honest like it's meant to help you. Right? So when you say challenge, I don't see that way to be honest. But yeah. So for me, it's more mostly something, a tool which can assist you and I haven't actually, maybe I haven't used it to the extent to say, hey, I really experienced this/these challenges. So yeah, not sure if I can answer that question properly. Yeah. Interviewer: Yeah, no good. Then, next question in your observation, did the use of generative AI tools influence, student engagement, learning approaches or assessment performance."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,75,"The use of Gen AI. Well, definitely, I believe, like, whenever you give any activity to the students like the first go to would be Gen AI and you try to encourage them not to and you try to get them like a lot of times I try to say, hey, guys, could you please close your laptops. Don't use your phone. Let's just have a chat as a group and whatnot, and then we can reach out if it needs be. But I guess like is pretty much something very prevalent. And we know that both that actually students, they use it very often, and that quite regularly. So. I believe a lot of responses they produce… I mean, I even like I can give you this example, like I had through the presentation. That's well, I mean the semester I remember, like in a couple of groups like I was surprised because I thought that was a very … there were 5 girls in that group, I felt like they were well spoken, native speakers. Maybe one of them wasn't but…and very sharp, right? So for the presentation I noticed that when they actually submitted a video, they actually use the AI voice like, they didn't actually speak themselves. And I was really, I didn't expect that, and I felt like, well, I thought, at least for you guys, if you were someone that your English was not your 1st language, but I guess, like obviously the content, the slides, the voice over everything was from Gen AI. Well, I mean, or at least mostly helped by it. Not everything like I can't say with that certainty. Obviously they worked on it because into graphic was what they produced during the class then, but it was just like a little disappointing to see that they're using in that capacity where they could have actually easily use their own voices, and, you know, make make it more interesting. But yeah, so…could be, yeah, I guess, like, it's quite popular now, and very common for students to use GenAI Interviewer: You maybe have also, like a positive impact in mind?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,76,"I guess it, it can be positive, like I can see the positive impacts of Gen AI in terms of even in my work, as I said, and personal life, and I always give these examples to my students, as I mentioned, like I even tell them like, hey, like I was traveling once, 1st time in this country, and then I arrived there. I had like 8 h, and I asked, ChatGPT, hey, I have 8 h. What do you think? Should I go to the airport in a hotel and stay there or… and then it gave me such a great itinerary that day. What to do, where to even sort of like park my suitcases, and then where to get this thing and which gate to use. And so I always say that, hey, this is an amazing tool, even for your personal life, and I understand I'm not telling you not to use it. But then, when you're using it. Remember these things…So yeah, it's good for the students to use it definitely. Yeah, and it can help them in terms of summarizing ideas, even articles like in other subjects, which I'm teaching is about media on media studies…so even what we're doing during the tutorial, we're getting them to sort of..there are certain sub concepts to get those concepts, go back to the lecture slides, get the definitions, but then go to Gen AI, ChatGPT whatever and then also get some sort of responses from there and then compare them. And I guess, like it's a very, it's a great tool. And this way the students, and even giving the whole sort of article or book chapter to Gen AI, get the summary, compare it with those things. So in those ways, Gen AI can be very helpful, I guess, especially for those students who kind of like they don't really like reading much so this can be something like, because they dread even looking at something like 30 pages, 20 pages. But by doing that I saw that how amazing they were kind of like, oh, all right, so it can simplify it for us. We can get what we want. And it just made sense to them. And I could tell right away like they showed more interest in this subject. So yeah. I guess it can be a great tool if you know how to use it for educational purposes. Interviewer: Nice great examples on both sides for negative and positive impact. Cool. Thank you. Next question, while marking, because you also mark for your subjects right? Did you observe whether students were able to critically evaluate AI generated content, or did they tend to rely on it without verification?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,77,"I'm not sure if I understood your question. I mean. Interviewer: Maybe I can also copy and paste it really quick in the chat makes it easier to follow along. So while marking, did you observe whether students were able to critically evaluate AI generated content, or did…?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,78,"How? How am I supposed to see that? Like, I'm not sure like, why, in what sort of context we're talking about it. Like to evaluate AI created content. So what do you mean by that, or how you mean that? Interviewer: For example, if students were referencing generative AI in their work…"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,79,"To provide a critic about what the generative AI has given them. The response is that what you mean? Interviewer: Yes, so it was apparent that they're not just copy and paste it, or like just solely use this as their single reference. But at the same time built up even more around what has been provided through generative AI as an example."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,80,"Very good point, but I never looked to be honest. I've never looked into that that in that sort of like with those with that kind of sort of concern. Because, yeah, I mean, we have this thing that they need to really disclaimer that if they have used any GenAI, they need to really provide screenshots of their sort of correspondence with the AI or whatever they had. But I'm not sure, I never actually, I just visited that quickly and I saw right, so this student has sort of like provided the screenshots as we requested, and they acknowledge that they use the AI. But that's the way. But they haven't copy pasted. Not sure if, like. I never paid attention to the critic or anything as such about GenAI. But we had actually, I guess we have…I'm not sure for information system for other subjectsm we have this where they get the response, like, even from again the media studies, we get them to sort of like when it comes to data to sort of use ChatGPT or any other sort of AI tools for the definition. And and then also what we provide thought  and where we just like, we don't mean just binary sort of figures and values or not. But we're talking about the sensory things. And then to show them, hey, what you get from GenAI is not quite the exact thing that you need to use, and it can give you the wrong. Or we had other instances like, yeah, the teaching purposes. But that's as far as I can tell you, really. But yeah, so no. Interviewer: Have you maybe seen misuse of generative AI within student work?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,81,"Yeah, I mean, we had instances when we reported them where they got really actually detected by…not again at UTS but at UNSW, again… we have this on Turnitin we have this AI score as well. So it goes above 0, then that means that they have. And I had acouple of students they had like one, was the AI sort of similarity was 70%. The other one was quite high. So we reported them under the rest is with the integrity team. Interviewer: Interesting. Do you, do you feel like this tool is useful at UNSW, or it has also some drawbacks?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,82,"No, no, we definitely don't want them to copy paste from it. We encourage them to use them, but we don't want them to get the ride up from GenAI and submitted right? So that's the thing. That's the point. Interviewer: But I mean Turnitin the way it is used at UNSW, would you wish to see the same strategy at UTS?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,83,"Oh, you mean if they have used AI! Well, I guess that it that would be good. Actually, if we we have sort of like a comity where we we do have that at UTS as well. But I'm not sure if…I guess UNSW is a bit stricter when it comes to to that. At least, that's that's how I actually see it. Or at least it can get flagged. Interviewer: Do you maybe have any strategies or interventions in mind that could support the development of students critical evaluation skills in regards to generative AI in future offerings?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,84,"You mean to critique AI, or the use of AI? Interviewer: To use AI in a more sensible way, so you don't just like rely on it, but you also critically engage with it."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,85,"Yeah, I guess I gave you a few examples where I don't know if you've noticed, bu to even bring this to student attention. So I guess what we have at UTS now, so the sort of disclaimer to show us how they used AI that gives them a little bit of more understanding that, hey if I'm using it, I have to take responsibility and be accountable for it, and I can't copy paste stuff. I guess the other things like to show them that how Gen AI is never perfect, and it can sort of like again the hallucination, or even sometimes it just creates these references which they don't even exist, and whatnot so…maybe allowing the students to be able to see those instances and for them to understand that all right, so they can't solely rely on it. They can...it can assist us, but they can't really 100% rely on it. And critically looking at it, because I mean, again, it comes to yeah, perhaps these things can be I don't know, somehow included in those subjects or different subjects. Somehow, perhaps that could be more useful. But again, this is something that all, I guess academic institutions now dealing with it, and the concerns around how the students use AI and how they can critically look at it and use it. Obviously, that has been an open discussion for a while and an ongoing discussion. And yeah, I guess that is more comes with the awareness, like really to raise the awareness and perhaps creating some even sort of lessons, or including some modules, or even trainings, for them to be able to see or do that comparison, and that can really be helpful to them. Yeah. And then, I guess, encouraging them to use it to help them to look at things from various perspectives, or help them summarize things or help them to this and that, but not only relying on that which, again, yeah, can be a very useful thing. Interviewer: Okay, awareness is a good topic that I want to talk next about. To what extent were students aware of ethical guidelines for using generative AI in their assessments? At least the assessments that you saw. What was your impression?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,86,"Try to remind them about it, like in each subject. But also it's always now part of every subject outline. So the in the course content and subject outlines we have, and for each assignment we also have a section about AI, and how they need to be sort of like accountable and responsible for the use of AI, and the fact that how they can use or whatnot. I guess there has been this included, and I guess, like in classes, most time. We try to also bring that to their attention as well. Interviewer: There was a rather high awareness around this, or even though there's so much provided, there was little awareness."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,87,"I wouldn't call it little awareness. I know that students, they know about it. I know that if the really high achieving students, they would always keep that in the mind. But I guess they try to keep it…to actually ignore it sometimes you know what I mean. So, it doesn't mean that they don't know about it, that they shouldn't use it but they still make an attempt…They try to use it in a way that might not be so if they're really cheeky, well, they actually can turn a blind eye on it. But yeah. Interviewer: You mentioned already a couple of things. But maybe we can go back to this point real quick…what strategies could even further improve their understanding and application of these guidelines that exist?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,88,"I guess, as I mentioned, I'm repeating myself again, perhaps trainings, perhaps... Yeah. I mean, we already doing, we've already actually at sort of university level…we've started implementing and also embedding those AI sections in every subject outline, material assignment, material assessment material. So I guess these are all good positive steps. But what what we've been doing, for example, for information system…yeah, I mean, the students get the chance to work with different tools of AI, and we have this, for example, we had this lesson where they get to use sort of Copilot and different sort of AI versions, and they compare the responses and whatnot which is which is good actually. I think, for them to be able to see how these tools or platforms can help them. Yeah, definitely. These are the things that I consider positive sort of steps towards this awareness. Interviewer: okay, next question. You already mentioned one of them but maybe you have another example in mind, did you encounter any ethical concerns, for example, over reliance on AI, plagiarism, misuse of AI tools. You were mentioning the presentation that solely relied in the end on GenAI."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,89,"That was the, there was a voice over, yeah. So yeah, I think I gave you already, a couple of examples at least, if not more. So the voice over, I had a couple of students, not at UTS, but where they had sort of the high similarity level AI report which they got detected and noticed. And you know we had to, actually, I had to sort of there were, there's a special form that you need to fill up and you know, screenshots of the student assessment task and whatnot. And then you leave it to them. And then they would decide in the committee, on the right approach and consequences for the students, for their misconduct behaviour. So I'm sure that the students they use it. Some might be even sort of more successful than the others to use it and get away with it. But honestly, these days, I mean, it's very hard to tell, like I mean, especially when it comes to marking assignments because we're dealing with a like considerable volume of assignments, though I'm not talking only about information systems because we don't have really much. I mean, the load of marking is really a lot lighter and better. But I mean for the other assignments, like, for example, PMP that I've been doing for several years. We have a lot of assignment and assessment markings, interim reports, final reports and it's just like we're constantly. And then imagine when you have so many students, and then you have to go through them, and you can't really, every single time, just like always oh is it AI? and then I can guarantee Fabian like several years ago, when I…marking, was a headache. Some of the sentences were so broken, so badly written like I mean, honestly, you would have felt like I wanted to hit my head to the wall because I could. It didn't make sense. Now, all of a sudden, after AI, like writings are almost perfect. I mean even. And it's either…I'm talking about international students where the English is not their 1st language. So you can only tell how all of a sudden, like we had this sort of jump in terms of academic writing. So definitely, there has been these improvements, not just because it's not because we have like all of our students, all of a sudden they are 100% fluent in English writing and great writers. But I believe that that comes from the fact that they're using AI 1 way or another, and also like some tools like I mean, not only well, I mean, they are also like grammarly this and that, and so many translators whatever. So I mean, it is obvious that this change all of a sudden, and this sharp lift in the academic level, definitely comes from somewhere, and that I guess, like we we both know where it's coming from. But yeah so how to really detect a hundred percent certainty where everybody's using it, I guess, like we just need to accept it as a fact. But then, encouraging the students, hey, use it, but when you're using it, don't copy and paste it. Try to put it in your own language. That's a fair sort of I guess, request and requirement. And that is what we've actually, I guess everybody actually arrived at this decision now, because we kind of we know that it is impossible to stop it, and there's no need to stop it. Why would we even do that like? If it's there and everybody can use it? Then let's use it. But then how can we integrate that in our education system, in our studies as our sort of like study buddy or whatever to help us to. Really. So I guess that's a great tool. Interviewer: I agree. Yeah. 100%. I think it's actually the turn for university to make a move right now, and to show how they can adjust. It's less the students fault, in my opinion, if there's like misuse around generative AI, it's more like university have to move quicker to really adjust to those changes."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,90,"Absolutely. Yeah. Interviewer: And this leads me to my next question. We already talked about the fact that there is subject guidelines that there's some activities around generative AI. From your perspective, how effective would you see those current subject guidelines for assessments, for subjects itself, for those tutorials, or even the activities and the resources provided in subjects around generative AI."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,91,"In general. Interviewer: In general, yeah."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,92,"I guess that's the repetition of what I've already mentioned. So I guess, like, it's been a good sort of inclusion and addition, and the fact that we are, so these sections about Gen AI has been has become part of like every assessment, assignment, subject, outline, and definitely it is very hard for any student to miss that, and you know and the fact that. Interviewer: But in terms of their quality…in terms of their quality of what has been provided. Not, I know it's provided but what do you think about the quality of."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,93,"It's more like instructions and guidelines. Right? So the quality is, it does serve the purpose. I can't see how it can be improved, because I guess so far, like I mean, I don't know. I mean, perhaps I haven't thought about it as much, but I guess the way it is, it does the job for now. Yeah. Interviewer: Then let me look into the last 2 questions. I feel like the last course. The second last question you already answered. It's kind of like looking ahead. What improvements would you suggest for integrating Gen AI tools more effectively into assessments and learning activities? That is done Interviewer: But the last question for today is what types of resources, support, or professional development would be most valuable for you as a tutor, to help you confidentially teach in AI integrated subjects in the future?"
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,94,Confidently. Interviewer: Confidently sorry.
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,95,"Confidently to teach AI tools to the students, is that what you're asking? Interviewer: Yeah, like, what types of resources would you like to see into or support or professional development that would help you as a tutor to teach in this new, AI-integrated world of subjects."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,96,"I guess, as we just already discussed, perhaps like could be good, perhaps if we have some trainings around.. I don't know what is available, what can be done, maybe more than what we are already doing? In terms of AI, and how we can. That could be a good step actually. So to, even in terms of bringing more sort of consistency to the teaching team. I guess that'd be good. If I mean even like there would be some trainings around that, because, as I said, I mean well, I mean, we both know that there are different AI tools at the moment like and perhaps a lot of us. We're using one or another more than other tools, I mean. As I said. I'm only using ChatGPT, but I'm sure that there are other like Copilot this and that like, I mean, they can even be more useful when it comes to it, I don't know. Creating. Powerpoint slides like you give the material and say, hey, help me with this and that. So that's a cool thing. And we have AI now for every profession. Now we have it for lawyers. We have it for education. We have it, for I don't know if you're a designer, we have it if you're an architect. So I guess to perhaps the training could be around what sort of AI tools can be used, and how you can sort of like implement like this, these AIs into your teaching, or how you can get some help from them. That could be a beneficial, I guess, training provided to us, but also like in terms of the perhaps, the what university wants us to really look into. And you know. Consider in terms of and deliver to the students like in terms of AI, how to use it or whatnot. We have that, but maybe more sort of like in a more constructive way. So that can be, this can be sort of helpful, I believe. Okay, nice. That's about it. Thank you so much for your time."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,97,"No, worries, Fabian. All the best with your research. Interviewer: Thank you. Do you have any other questions for me, or."
tutor,31266,Autumn,Third,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,98,Not really.
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,AUT-P04,AUT-P04,1,Interviewer: I hope it's okay if I record this session for data analysis.
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,2,"Yeah. Interviewer: Nice, okay Maybe I'll give you just a quick introduction to what we're gonna talk about in the next couple of minutes."
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,3,"Yeah. Interviewer: So, basically, this interview session is to reflect on your experience teaching in an AI-integrated subject, like 31269 is, and we will explore your familiarity with generative AI tools, how they were used or observed during the semester, and your general thoughts on student engagement, ethical concerns, and the support provided by university, by the subject coordinator, and so on. And this study is part of the FFYE grant, which is a first and further year experience grant. Basically, it captures first-year students, and this study aims to understand how students engage with AI-integrated assessments and how they develop evaluative judgment skills when working with those tools for learning and reflection. The ultimate goal of this study is to, maybe based on the insights, to help shape future assessment strategies, and also improve curriculums of subjects like 31269 that are part of the BIS courses at UTS. Yeah, so that's the broad overview of this interview study, and that's why you're also invited, as well as all the other academic tutors in this subject."
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,4,"Yeah make sense so far, or… Yeah, that makes sense.. Interviewer: Nice, so I think we just go through the interview questions. I have some interview questions prepared. I will always post the interview question also in the chat, so you can read along. Makes it sometimes easier. Yeah, maybe let's just…start straight away with the first question, and the first question is, what was your level of familiarity with generative AI tools before teaching the subject?"
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,5,"Okay, fantastic. Interviewer: Briefly describe specific tools you used, or you, yeah."
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,6,"My Personal? I think, yeah, I… I used to… to go and check, I mean… In my day-to-day work, I have, like, an internal tool. I can’t disclosure the name, but I have a GenAI tool to… that helps us to find out some documentation, some NOLID-based information. And, also, from personal purposes, I use Gemini, I use, also, sometimes ChatGPT. But usually, I just like to go to the Gemini, because it's a Google tool, and I think it's easy to use, and it provides some APIs for us to configure, and then just going through and just explore more things, for example, development size of things. Visual stuff, so let's say you want to create something for, any particular brand or any particular marketing purposes, that's also good. So, yeah, I used to work on those ones before to teaching. Interviewer: So quite familiar with those tools?"
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,7,"Yeah. Nice. Interviewer: Great. Next question, and you were already talking about some of it for your professional work. How frequently do you use generative AI tools in your professional work? Let's say teaching, administration, research, maybe also for you in industry?"
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,8,"Okay, to be honest, it depends, the purpose of… oh, not the purpose, but when do I need to use those ones, but usually, if I just wanted to use those ones to check, let's say, grammar, or let's say the structure. If I wanted to summarize some of the responses or text that I wanted to share with some formal people, or something like that, I used to go to Gemini and just do that one. For my day-to-day, I use that one frequently to find some good resources. We have, like, a database repository, and then that GenAI tool was created to just extract some information and help us to figure it out, which one is going to be the best resource to support some of our work. So…to answer your question about how frequent do I use that…it depends, so, for example, a week I can use one… twice, maybe one or two days, but no whole day, just, like, a few minutes, or maybe one or two hours maximum, because if just… just to do a quick search. That’s what I used to do, and if I have all, let's say for the grammar or the structured stuff, I just used to prepare everything beforehand, and then just run it on those internal ones, and then just use that. But no, to be honest, I am not really a fan of using those Gen AI tools too much. For coding perspective, probably… I was teaching another subject. I just used to… I just used to, manage some of the tools to run some scripts for some of the subjects, technical subjects that I used to teach before, but just to test if the script was right for me, or for my students, or for my lecture, or for my tutorial. But yeah, a part of that, no more… no more than that. Interviewer: Okay, great, hank you so much for those insights. Next question. So, prior to this subject, had UTS provided you with any training, resources, or support on the ethical use of generative AI in education?"
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,9,"I remember I was working in LX Lab and at that point, we were… I mean, they were running some of the… I mean, that was pretty high level because at that point, or at that time, they started to find out that, the new era of Gen AI tools, they are just coming. So we were discussing something about the vertical stuff and all of those things. So, I just received from them some training b ecause they support, the teaching staff, doing everything in Canvas, and all of those things. So they start doing that. They didn't have, like, a proper tool to manage all the, let's say, all the documentation, information, anything like that, but we just received a training. That was a short training and that helps us to understand and be mindful of how we have to use those GenAI, and also how we need to treat those GenAI tools with the students, and also within the classrooms, and also with the teaching.. I would say with the teaching semester, or something like that. But yeah. Interviewer: How useful did you find them, or maybe what other additional support or training would you like to see being offered by UTS?"
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,10,"Okay, I think that was useful at that time to know what to do but, it should be good for… for us, or for the… for UTS to just have like a bit of strategies on how can we approach to the students that they are using the GenAI tools frequently, and how can we just catch when they are using that in the right way, let's say to learn, and not to just, let's say to attempt to present some of the assessment of weekly tasks using GenAI instead of their minds, so I know that is a bit tricky to do it at the moment. But probably maybe some strategies for us to be prepared, and just if we just find out any similarity on information, just not Turnitin.. it's just maybe some similarities with GenAI, or some strategies to pick some of the, let's say information or data that is just taken from some of those tools…Just to alert us and say, hey, those students are just using Gen AI and all the subject or all the material or everything. And then, how are we going to approach those students? Are we going to penalize them? Are we going to maybe, use a different strategy to just let them know, hey, this one is not the way on how to use it, please just follow those resources and find out some test cases for you to be aware of this one, because you need to use your mind or your knowledge, your own logic, instead of the Gen AI to logic, or something like that. I think that should be one thing, and the second thing is, from governance perspective is how are we treating that from compliance and regulations, from academic perspective, and also from a student perspective. If that's something which is, which will be penalized, or if it's something that needs to follow some procedure from, let's say, governance and compliance and, the another one is, from ethical perspective, what is the guidance on that? I mean, I have been hearing a lot of discussion about the ethical in Gen AI, but what exactly is that, and how can we just provide that information to the students, and also for them to be aware of the implications. So I think those three sort of things are the things that I was thinking, yeah. Interviewer: Great, thank you. Back to where we started, but now looking closely to, or at 31269, how did you integrate generative AI into your teaching or assessment feedback? during this subject."
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,11,Wow.
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,12,"To be honest… To be honest, I didn't… I didn't use any GenAI to provide feedback. First of all, because that subject is purely from technical side, I mean, it's… I mean, it's… it's between business and technical, but, we have some approach, we have some patterns to follow, we have some templates already provided to the students, so there is no way for them to maybe… oh, for us, not for them, for us to probably ask ChatGPT or some of those GenAI tools to provide feedback based on this report. So what I used to do, and I think probably I am an early school, is, is just to go into the documents, read everything and then run some tests before that, and then assess. So, for example, when I say test, if I need to review some diagram, I used to create the diagram before, then have the diagram for myself, and then based on my diagram, just start writing my feedback, and then providing the feedback to the students. And also, we have the rubric, right? So we can follow the step-by-steps of the criteria that we have in the rubric, and based on that, we can provide feedback. So I think that's better, instead of using Gen AI tool to provide feedback, because that will probably have a gap with the students. Sometimes there is a gap. And in the reports, I mean, I have been…I have been facing some particular, I mean, issues. not myself.. I mean, in some scenarios, when people just used to run the entire reporting to some of those Gen AI tool and they are just doing some bridge on the rules and the regulations, just putting those details there. And also, with the answer from those tools, the answer is not accurate, and it's not, like, an in-deep…I mean, analysis behind that, which just guide me to think, hey, no, I think that is not a good idea. So, in summary, no, I don't use that. I didn't integrate, to be honest. If it's… I mean, if that is the way on how are we thinking about integration is, for example, if I have let's say, yeah, Copilot, right? And how can I use Copilot, to provide feedback or something during the subject…, so I didn't use that one, to be honest. I don't like to do it. Interviewer: And for teaching and tutorial preparation?"
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,13,"For teaching… I think for teaching preparation, that's good, but again, I… I just use that to check, for example, some resources. When I get those resources, or let's say if I am preparing let's say one topic, sequence diagram, for example. If I'm preparing that one, I just ask for, just to provide some example on the sequence diagram. But usually they are inaccurate, so I have to go and revisit, but I just checked the resources. So, for example, I used to provide to the students some dummy resources for them to understand what to do from the beginning that is something that I used to do, just to pick some of the resources, tested those resources in the right web page or something like that, download those one and share that. So, it's useful to prepare. But you have to use your mind and also use your experience to test that information. Interviewer: All right, great. The next question, I feel like you answered already a lot of it. It's, in your opinion, what were the most significant challenges in incorporating generative AI into your teaching or assessments? For feedback, you already gave a good answer, I would say, in terms of challenges, but maybe you can also think of some challenges in terms of teaching."
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,14,"Yeah, that's… that's interesting. I mean, for… for this… for this particular subject, as I am not involved 100% in the teaching preparation or in the material preparation, because that is something that the lecturers and the subject coordinator usually do. The tutors, we only have the documentations, but as I say, so I wanted to be prepared and go to the student with some exercise and example before, in that situation is where I use. So some of the significant challenge, was because I was thinking to incorporate some of the tools, especially Copilot, because we have access to that… is the inaccurate information that I couldn't find sometimes. So, probably now, that is different, because a lot of organizations, they are using Copilot and most of the Gen AI tools, but when I just did it, I think that was one or two years ago, I think one, one and a half years ago. I was just teaching… I was just coordinating one subject, when I was at uni. And, I tried to incorporate new content, just create some separate modules, just for that particular subject. But when I just wanted to find out some real test cases. That was… I mean, the information that I got was inaccurate, so I have it to go through and read, so you have to double test it…Which is something that we used to do, right? But, to be honest, I prefer to go to the resources that I like, the databases that I know, the key resources that I know, and just double-check that the information is right or not. But for coding perspective, that's good. So I just tested, I just reused some of those ones, changed some of the naming conventions for those ones. And just explain to the student what is the meaning of those ones, because usually the student go through and run the same thing, and they will find out the same. So what I did is just test it by myself, but reusing some information. So I think, the challenges sometimes is that…depending on how you approach those questions through those, GenAI tools, is how you can get the right information. But if you don't know how to play around with those applications, that is… that is going to be tricky, and that is going to double your work. Just to review and to redo things. So yeah, I think that's my… My takeaway from this one. Interviewer: Alright, thank you for sharing. Next question. In your observation, did the use of generative AI tools influence student engagement, learning approaches, or assessment performance? Also looking at 31269?"
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,15,"Learning approaches. Yeah, I think... Interviewer: Can be positive and negative, both. I want to hear both."
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,16,"Yeah. Learning approach that's going to be…that is going to impact a lot in the learning approach, because… I think the students are just getting a bit lazy sometimes. I mean, they used to be like that, but now they are getting more because they believe that if they use GenAI, quickly they can get any tax or any assessment done, right? From us, it's a little bit of more work, because we have to double-check the work that they are doing. Probably with the Turinitin tools, we can just find out the similarities in some of them, but we have to just review those one again. But I think, the learning approach is one of the things, because, they can think, hey, GenAI can solve everything. Right? Or some of the tools. But they are wrong, because they need to put a little bit of effort and review, and make sure that everything is aligned. So I think that is one thing. Student engagement…not really. It depends as well, because for… for 31269, they are still engaged. But maybe for some part of the assessments I think they are not too engaged, because they think, for example, if we ask for functional… sorry, for non-functional requirements focused on security and, let's say, performance. They used to go to ChatGPT or Copilot and ask for that. Just provide some context, and they can get that copy and paste. That's all, right? So probably that's the only thing that I… I can just mention, but more… but from, let's say artifacts perspective, how to build the requirements and everything, they are really engaged with the team, so which is good. And for assessment performance, also is impacting in negative ways, because, I think they are still using that, and they are not acknowledged the use of Gen AI, so they are forgetting that and, and also they are not using the right resources. They have not referencing them, in any document, in any formal report. So that's going to impact them as well. I mean, that is my observation. Interviewer: Alright, nice. Thank you for sharing, Will."
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,17,"Yeah. Interviewer: Next question, you already mentioned just one, not acknowledging it. While marking, did you observe whether students were able to critically evaluate AI-generated content, or did they tend to rely on it without verification?"
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,18,"Okay, yes, I think they… they did, and we have some of the tasks, I think the subject coordinator, she… she has started adding some information… not some information, some tasks for them to have a look on the GenAI tools and maybe just compare what they… what they get from GenAI and what they get from themselves. Just to see the accuracy on that. And I think that was a good example and a good strategy for the student to be aware that the work that they are doing is better than the work that they can get from those tools. Because they can think about… I mean, they can have a deep analysis and deep understanding on the case study, and based on that information and that mindset, they can just start creating, brainstorming, and doing stuff…instead of just going directly through the tools. So, I think that is interesting, because they are aware of that, and I think that is why, they just prefer to do the artifacts by themselves, because they find out that we know that if we go through those tools and just find out which one is the diagram or the artifact, we can just find out that everything is just copy and pasted, right? So… but I think, yeah, that is one of the strategies that we use. And, the other thing is, in class, I used to provide some examples as well before to start the weekly task exercise. I just create my own example. That is not from the weekly tasks, let's say, for this week, just… I just…just tell them based on the previous task. So, I just developed that task, I just reused what the team did for that task, and then I just asked through Copilot, or just generate through Copilot some particular example, and then I just put and compare. I didn't do that every class, I just did that one when I just feel that the students are… they are not performing well with that activity, and I am feeling that they are using Copilot to generate some of those answers. So I used that one, and at the beginning of the class as feedback, I just put it down on the screen, and start doing some 5-minute feedback on that. And then I think that is another strategy for them to be aware that, hey that is not a way to use those tools without, our validation. Interviewer: That's a great approach. I really like this approach. Excellent, nice."
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,19,"Yeah. Interviewer: Alright, thank you for sharing. Next question, to what extent were students aware of ethical guidelines for using generative AI in their assessments?"
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,20,"Most of them… no, some of them…were aware of those ethical guidelines as per the subject online, and also as per the projects that we usually run. And also because, in my experience, I used to start the session just, putting the rules just at from which are we going to have in my classes. So one of the rules is this one, it's just the ethical guidance. And, I think they are aware of that, and I also highlight those sections in the subject online for them to be aware. And also in the FAQ section that we have in Canvas. So, I think I always refer to them to those ones. And from, industry perspective, that is something that I just highlight. I just told… I just tell to them, or told to them..hey guys, this one is how these particular topics… this topic is hold in the industry, because we have to be careful on how are we using that. So I just put in some of the latest news, for example, around consulting, around, let's say, what was happening in Optus, what was happening in Deloitte, what was happening in some of the organizations, for them to know what… which one are the implications behind the use of Gen AI tool. Interviewer: But you would still say only some of the students are really aware of the ethical guidelines, right?"
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,21,"Some of them, yeah, not all of them. Interviewer: You already mentioned some strategies that you're doing to create more awareness. Do you have maybe some more in mind, some more strategies that could improve their understanding and application of these guidelines."
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,22,"I think… Okay, that's… that's a good one. Because at the moment, we have snd they are across that, which is the acknowledgement section that we used to have in each of the weekly tasks and, just for them to know, it's probably…to have a conversation, or just include as part of the lecture, slides, for example some section with those guidance. For, let's say…maybe start, middle, and end of the semester, for all of them to be aware on what… which one are our ethical guidance across the using of Gen AI. And, also, we should have, same as we have staff information or subject online information, we should have, like, like a guidance, ethical guidance, one specific page, just to highlight all of those… all of those things, instead of having those ones in FAQs, because usually the students, they don't like to go to the FAQs frequently. So maybe just to highlight the importance of those ones in the main pages of Canvas courses, that should be good. And… maybe have a training for the student as well. Maybe in… same as…because the students have, like, the initial week at Uni, so probably we can have, like, a workshop. Or, like, yeah, like, sessions with all the students around this topic. Because I know we have been discussing from research perspective on which one are the ethical implications of the use, using of the GenAI, but what about the students? How they can just process this information? Which one are going to be their position on that? So maybe create a forum for them to discuss on this one, maybe from personal perspective, and also from professional perspective. I think that is… that also will enrich the discussion on ethical guidance. And also for them to be aware, because it's just not only how are we going to approach that to them, it's how they are going to take this one, and then how are they going to be involved in this particular thing. But yeah, those ones are my strategies, I think. Those ones are good. So usually, from industry perspective, Fabi, I think we used to run different workshops with different stakeholders. So, we can… we have, like, panel sessions, we have some panellists talking about different topics, so let's say ethical guidance. And, we have different people from different backgrounds discussing around them, and they can probably share their stories, share some particular case studies or use cases, and then based on that we can probably discuss and probably train people on how to do… how to use that one, and also how the government and the education and the minister, they are treating those particular guidance, so I think that's something that we can maybe implement in the future. Interviewer: Nice. Thank you so much for sharing, Will. I appreciate.. it costs energy and some brainpower to think about this, so thank you so much for taking it."
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,23,Thank you.
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,24,"Next question. My favorite one, did you encounter any ethical concerns over reliance on AI, plagiarism, misuse of AI tools in your classes in 31269?"
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,25,"Over-reliance and  AI plagiarism,no..I mean, to be honest, no. I… I think maybe the misuse of AI tools during the weekly task because, I mean, they used the AI tool, they didn't acknowledge the use of AI tool, and they didn't put the resource on the use. So, once I just run the plagiarism section, I can find out that. And I can… I can just run the question through one of the tools, let's say Copilot, and I can find… I just find out the same thing in some of those responses, right? But what I did in those situations. That happened to me just only with, I think, one student. And, what happened, I just marked that student accordingly. And, I just highlight, I just had a separate conversation with the student and say, hey, you can do this one because it's your learning, it's your knowledge, and you have to put in place that one, and if you don't know, you have to get back to me, and probably to your teammates, and try to figure it out, how to solve that question. Or if you are not sure, just feel free to reach out to me, and I can explain you, instead of doing that. But yeah, I think that's… that's the only situation that I just encountered. Because, usually the plagiarism that I find out is just related to the headers, the questions, because they didn't remove those things and, but from content perspective and, information perspective, I haven't encountered something really, let's say, tricky to manage, no. Interviewer: Thank you so much for sharing, Will. Next question. How effective were the current subject guidelines of 31269, scaffolding activities, and resources in promoting ethical and critical use of generative AI?"
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,26,"I think they were… I mean, they are useful but sometimes the students find the activities a bit boring, to be honest. Because they say, okay, those ones are not part of, the subject, so sometimes we have, like, survey, so sometimes we have to acknowledge that in every task, so they sometimes find out that a bit boring, because they don't like to do that one. They like to be focused on the core topic of the subject, right? I know it's tricky for them to understand that we are doing that one just as an strategy for them to be aware and also to acknowledge whatever they are doing, using those gen AI tools. And, but yeah, I think… I think that's one thing that I find out in those ones. But the resources are good. I think, the information that the subject coordinator provides, the activities in class, the activity during semester…We used to have, like, like a survey every, I think\ three to four classes. I know, I think that is every two classes. It's like, their expectations, and also how they feel, and how they can improve, and how can we do to improve… those ones are some questions that we use to ask. To be honest, we have just only two questions. And, some of them, they like to participate, but most of them, they don't like to participate. So, I didn't, it's pretty tricky, because most students, especially the undergraduate students, they are not really interested on that one. And, some of the postgraduate, but this subject is pretty much from undergraduate students, so most of them are interesting, most of them are questioning a lot of things. But not all of them. So, just from critical perspective, I think it's okay, but we can do a little bit more. So, for example, we can provide, like, as I just mentioned, like, a workshop with the students, just to provide real test case scenarios, and just to tell them, hey, this one was happening because we didn't be aware of the ethical use of the Gen AI, and this happened in any organizations, and they… they can be aware of that, and they can say, hey, I have to stop doing that from my learning pathway. And then be ready for the industry in the future, so that it will be good for them. So that's something that I think we have to do, and another thing is, maybe just put up that from those ethical guidance at the beginning. Because the students…they used to follow the same structure from the previous semesters, so I think we have to change slightly that ways of working or that ways of teaching to them. And then try to maybe bulk that a little bit to be more phrenetical perspective on how to use those tools, instead of just putting content, and then keeping that content for them to read, because they are not going to read. We have to be more practical. So, especially the undergraduate students, so we have to provide them a practical learning. No, like, a conceptual or theoretical learning, which is something that we have at the moment in the… in different… in different subjects. Interviewer: Nice, thank you so much for sharing, Will. I think this is also already a partial answer to the next question. Looking ahead, what improvements would you suggest for integrating generative AI tools more effectively into assessments and learning activities? You were just mentioning one of them, but maybe also for assessments."
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,27,"I think in here… it's not just only this subject, but UTS has to think about more broadly. And, more from high, high-level perspective…is on how to create their own Gen AI tool, right? Let's say, same as Microsoft did for Copilot, same as Woolworths created their own compliance tool, same as, many organizations, they create… Commonwealth Bank, they create their own AI tool, so UTS have to invest on that particular initiative and start creating those machine learning stuff and, coding stuff just focus on assessment and learning activities. How effectively we can, probably be vigilant on what the students are doing, if they are using, in the right way, the tools, and how effectively they are using those ones. So, I don't know if they have been thinking on that, but I know that that should be possible to create. Combining, of course, multiple tools, because it's not just only the Gen AI stuff, they can be maybe with, the plagiarism tools, maybe some alerts for the students and the teachers, or maybe something like that, just to integrate those ones into the learning pathway, that should be good. Because it's not just only, Fabi, just wait until the student just submits their task or their assessment for us to find out that they are probably using in the wrong way the Gen AI tools. Probably beforehand or before the student just goes to attempt those weekly tasks or assessment, they can get some alert and say, hey, hold on, you are doing this one wrong, you are using the Gen AI, but this one is not right. So you have to change the way of creating your… your responses for your topics or for your assignments. And, based on that, they can probably be aware of, hey, I can… I cannot do that one anymore, and I can just use the GenAI tool in a different way. I don't know if that is going to be tricky, but yeah, I think that is one way that I was thinking. The another one, just per subject perspective, should be, probably… no, I think… I think we… we have in place the assessment, I mean, the questions, we have in place the acknowledgement, we have in place…the discussion that we have in class, Yeah, I think… I think… I don't know what else we can…we can do to improve that. I mean… We have Copilot, we are… we have telling them, hey, this one is…the secure tool that you can use, because it's…it's a partnership between Microsoft and UTS, and they can just use that one with their own UTS account. But yeah, I don't have… something else in my mind at the moment, to be honest. So yeah, just to improve those ones. Let me… let me think about it, and I can get back on this one maybe during the conversation, but yeah, at the moment, I don't have any other ideas, sorry. Interviewer: I love the answer, because you're the second person that is suggesting a generative AI tool specifically for university. I will come back to this topic as soon as we stop the recording, but great, thank you for sharing."
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,28,"Yeah, no worries. Interviewer: Next question. What types… and it's actually already the last question, and then we just jump into some additional observation of the intervention activities that happened in week 5, 8, and 11. But yeah, last question is, what types of resources, support, or professional development would be most valuable to help you and other tutors confidently teach in AI-integrated subjects in the future? So you were already talking about workshops for students, but now let's change the perspective. Is there anything that you would like to see being offered, provided by UTS in terms of resources, support, professional development that could be valuable?"
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,29,"Yeah, I think… I think I know we have LXLab. I was… I was working on LXLab for a short time, helping the tutors and lecturers and subject coordinators to implement the Canvas site. And I know they have a lot of materials and knowledge base, but probably they could have, like, a dedicated, I don't know, a dedicated… no subject, but, like, a training staff to, to provide, or to just help the teaching staff to improve their ways of working and the ways of teaching using the GenAI tools, because I know that most people, they are like an old, or like a traditional teacher, so like a traditional, they used to run, in the traditional ways, how they just teach. But with the implementation of GenAI, we have to be opened and try to work on that, and we have to, because most of the students, they… they have that mindset, and they used to open those tools and just learn based on that. But yeah, I think that's one thing. The another one is, support from those people, also to teach on how to integrate. If they are, for example, thinking that Copilot can help to do something, but how? Just provide more guidance, user manuals to support us on how to do that, because sometimes we don't know everything, right? We can be good in our, in our skills, but not across everything, so probably they can provide some support on that. I know some of them, they have that capability, and they can provide that one. And from professional development, I think, but this one is more from personal perspective, it's just to… to…train by ourself. So, let's say we have LinkedIn page, or LinkedIn. So, UTS has LinkedIn courses there, so there are, like, a foundation of AI courses, basic things that all the staff can just start doing. Maybe just getting some badges, some certificates, just for us to be across everything, and also they can just open our minds and say, hey, this one is something that is happening at the moment. And this one is how you can work, because I did some, so that is what I think that should be better. Or maybe try in Coursera, or try in any free tools, or any free courses. I mean, UTS don't need to create a new course. There are plenty of them outside, and…maybe…using the partnership that we have, I mean, with different organizations, we can reuse those ones. So I know with LinkedIn, we can access to those ones. I mean, I can access those ones from my own profile. But also from Microsoft, we can just get and just probably check some… some particular courses that… just foundational ones, the basic ones. We don't need to be expert or specialist on that. That also helps with the professional development. And I know also that we have, as a tutors, like a course, where they, provide us some ways of teaching, some…some strategies to teach, something like that. I don't remember what is that course. I did that one in the past and, it's just, face-to-face course or training that is just one or two hours. Some of the LXLAB teams are involved, and also some FIT teams are involved. But what if we use that platform to probably increase, or maybe to bring some of those hot topics into that session, instead of just doing the same thing that we are… we used to do, because I just participated in two or three of them, and they were pretty similar. The only thing that changed was the lecturer, or the person who's just leading that. But, yeah, most… more than that is just be across that one, and just include those ones. And just for, yeah, professional development is just ourselves, just be interested. Find out outside what we can do just to improve ourselves. Interviewer: Great, thank you for sharing, Will. Let's jump into the last section, because we're also running out of time, and you probably have another meeting queuing up."
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,30,"Yes, that's right. Interviewer:. So let's make it quick. Observational data, can you maybe just give me some thoughts around what student enthusiasm you saw in class when students were working on those intervention activities in week 5, 8, and 11?"
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,31,"My god. In BRM, are we talking about? Interviewer: Yep."
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,32,"Okay, the enthusiasm? I think, was okay. Some of them, especially those students that are already involved in the industry, they were really interested. But I have a few, not many. So, I think they were keen, and, they were. asking questions about why are we using this one, what are you planning to do, why do we need this one in the academia? I don't remember one of my students, he just told me, hey, we are doing this, but we don't have the foundation of that, so that is why I am just mentioning that to you, I think. Most of the students are just first year, second year, or some of them, they are latest students that they didn't take this one, or they just maybe stopped studying and then get back. And, some of them, they just asked me, hey, but we don't have that foundation of what is the AI, or those sort of things, and now we are listening that you are trying to integrate that into our learning pathways, but how are we going to manage that? Do you have more information on that? That was a really… deep…discussion, or no deep discussion, deep question, and I just provide some answers from my perspective, but I think that's something that the university and also the subject itself needs to just look after, and just communicate. Check how to communicate, and what exactly are going to be the impact for the students. Interviewer: And let's… because we're running out of time, I know. What Generative AI tools, which were… which one were used? Mostly copilot in those moments of week 5, 8, and 11?"
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,33,"Usually, yeah, because I… I used to… we used to… to be focused on that one. I… I didn't ask for them to use different. I know they use different ones outside, you know, I can control that, but yeah, Copilot was the main one. Interviewer: And the objective itself, even though students were questioning why are we doing it, but the objective of the intervention activities was clear, so the comparison activity itself?"
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,34,"Yes, they… I think…I just get back to them and say, hey, this one is the aim for this particular task, but if you are keen to extend a little bit more, just get back to me, and we can chat. Because we… I used to discuss and provide time today and at the beginning of the class and I used to test if they are keen to do it, because as per the instructions from the subject coordinator, we have to be a bit flexible with them."
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,35,"So, I mean, on how they are going to respond, if they have time or not, but… oh, sorry, that was another activity. That was one survey that the subject created, but I remember that activity was just to compare one of the artifacts that we have to present, so I just…ask them to be focused on that particular task, and they ask on that, and if they have to expand that one, they just need to get back to me after they just complete everything. But yeah, I think that was pretty much… I think that was okay. And they find out that the activity was good, because they say, oh my god, yeah, I think the diagram that  I just did, based on your explanation and based on the subject guidance it's much better than the artifact that I got from those tools. So I think that was a really good outcome for some of the students. Interviewer: And last question, how teaching strategies evolved for yourself, so…what did you learn about guiding students in using generative AI tools responsibly, maybe, or critically?"
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,36,"Yeah, I just, I just, learned with them to be specific in the questions, how to create the right question to the tools, because sometimes if you didn't write the right questions, you didn't get the right resource. So I just… I just, teach them how to do it. And I just learned a couple of tricks and tips from them as well, because some of them, they… they are… they have really… they have a good experience doing so. So, that was good as well for me. That was my learning during… during those exercises. Interviewer: All right, thank you so much, Will. I'm going to stop the recording now."
tutor,31269,Spring,First,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,37,Sure.
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P01,SPR-P01,1,"Interviewer: For data analysis purposes, I'm gonna record this session, you already read the content form, and yeah, I hope that's okay for you."
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,2,"Alright. Interviewer: Yeah, beautiful. So, basically, today's session is to reflect on your experience as a tutor teaching in an AI-integrated subject, like 3126… 31269. And we will explore your familiarity with generative AI tools, how they were used and observed during the semester, and your general thoughts on student engagement, ethical concerns, and the support provided. It's part of the FFYE grant, the First and Further Year Experience Grants, and this study aims to better understand how students engage with AI-integrated assessments, develop evaluative judgment skills for learning and reflection. And the ultimate goal for this whole study, that we're conducting right now is based on the insights that we gather to help shape future assessment strategies and also curriculum improvements in BIS courses at UTS. Interviewer: Any questions before we start, with the questions that I've prepared?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,3,"No, alright, I think we can start. Interviewer: Cool, nice. Interviewer: So I'm always just gonna… you saw the majority of the questions already. Obviously, I will ask some follow-up questions based on what you're saying. I will always just paste the question into the chat, so you can also read it in the chat, might be quite helpful. Interviewer: So for the first question…What was your level of familiarity with generative AI tools before teaching the subject?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,4,"Well, I would say it… it was, like, low to medium. I use it, quite… not that, like, much, but yes, I have used it several times and, yeah, several purposes. So, yes, it is quite good, not, like, low to medium, I would say, yeah. Interviewer: Any specific tools that you knew or used?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,5,"Yeah, I mostly use ChatGPT, mostly for reading purpose. Interviewer: Cool. Next question. Interviewer: I put it in the chat again. How frequently do you use generative AI tools in your professional work? Let's say teaching, administration, research?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,6,"So it's basically the currently, right? Interviewer: Currently. Currently, and maybe if you want to also, if it changed to…half a year ago, a year ago, you can also reflect on this."
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,7,"Yes, so yes, so now it… I often, generally, I choose, very frequently, I would say. For every purpose, like teaching, administrating, and even for my personal, queries and everything. And yeah, if I compare, two years ago. Yeah, the use of, use of, generative AI tool, increased so much. Yeah, it has increased so much. Interviewer: So you use it basically for teaching, for administration? For, yeah, for, for my res… yeah, for my reading research, yeah, for everything. Interviewer: Next question. Prior to the subject, had UTS provided you with any training, resources, or support on the ethical use of generative AI in education?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,8,"Not really. I have been teaching this subject, BRM, in three semesters, like, that was… this is the third time I have teached this subject. So, yeah, so, so far, no. This is the first time we have… we have integrated AI with the subject, but yeah, no, we haven't received…Any kind of support like that. But, we have a module for the ethical use of generative AI on Canvas, so I have read that module, and I was trying to learn, like, what it is about, or how to acknowledge, or how to teach, or how to convey this message to students. For this purpose, I have…I went through the modules, and I have learned Through that module. Interviewer: And did you find those modules, or this module, useful?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,9,"Yes, yes, it was for me because I haven't, like, yet, as I said, I am new to teaching, and I haven't, like, involved in any other profession before that, so it was quite, useful for me. Interviewer: Is there any additional support or training you would like to see offered in the future?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,10,"Yes, I would say, for me, it is helpful, so yeah, I would love to, like, if we have any kind of support, any kind of, like, any instruction, any, anything, it could be, but yeah. It will help, definitely. Interviewer: Alright, next question. How did you integrate generative AI into your teaching or assessment feedback during the subject?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,11,"Okay, so I… I want to talk about feedback. So… Before…before this semester, in my previous two semesters, I haven't used GenAI for feedback, but this time I have used a lot, especially to write constructive feedback. So I think it was quite useful, because every time I went back to my students to ask that, is the feedback make sense to you, they had no questions. But when I haven't used GenAI, to write the feedbacks before in the previous semesters…they went… they came back to me and to ask the questions, like, to clarify the feedback more. But this time, I haven't, heard anything, heard anything from my students to clarify. So, in that way, I would say it was helpful to write the constructive feedbacks through Gen AI. And for teaching, yes, not much, because our subject is, like, diagram, heavy, most of them are diagrams, but yeah, sometimes I, sometimes I use GenAI to, like. Maybe to make the content easier for students to, to explore, like, what could be the teaching approach? To make it easier for students, and in that way, I have explored, or I have tried in many ways. It was helpful, but not that much. Interviewer: Okay, but sounds like a great approach, so you basically used it for teaching in that sense that you, because you're still new to teaching, to give you some advice around maybe how to make certain topics more engaging, or how to introduce them to students."
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,12,"Yes. Yes, I often, like, generate questions that I can ask to my students to make them engage, because we have just 2 hours to do all the tasks, and within these 2 hours, it was not like we have to provide the theory and recap the theory, like, comprehensively, but just to make them engage, I generated… sometimes I generate some questions. So that they can be engaged with the content, yeah. Interviewer: Nice. Great answers, thank you. I'm just gonna copy and paste the next question into the chat. In your opinion, what were the most significant challenges in incorporating generative AI into your teaching or assessments?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,13,"Oh… So, one could be, like, Verifying, like if the students have used GenAI or not, because sometimes they use it superficially, they don't acknowledge that they have used it. But when I… I know the students, right, during the class, what… how do they perform. But when I look at their submission it is… sometimes I feel some of the groups are not consistent, like, during the class, they don't listen to me most, or they don't pay attention to their task. But when I look at their submission, I find it like they have done really well. So, in that case, they might use it superficially, but they don't acknowledge. So, yeah, that could be a challenge, like..So, like, verifying… They have using the AI. What… is that your question? Interviewer: Yeah, this answers part of it, yes, so you would say the verification of student responses sometimes is a bit difficult for you, because they don't always acknowledge generative AI in the way they are supposed to, right?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,14,"Right. And what other challenges do you want to hear from me? Yeah? Interviewer: I think that's… That's already a good one, but you were mentioning…also that you use it for some parts into your teaching, your own teaching. Did you try to maybe use it differently, and you realized, okay, maybe this is the limitation of it that doesn't really contribute much to maybe my preparation of teaching."
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,15,"Yes, that could be one. Yep. Yeah, actually, it was, like, it needs a lot of prompts to prompt it. Okay, so if… yeah, it… yeah, it was not that helpful, but it was, it was. Interviewer: And especially the part of students not acknowledging generative AI appropriately…maybe also over-relying, to a certain extent. How could these challenges be better addressed in future offerings? What do you think?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,16,"Okay, so what I have done in this semester, first couple of weeks, I have… I have chose my students to acknowledge, or I… in the very first class, I have told them… I have made it very clear that you have to acknowledge whatever you do, you have to acknowledge, okay, either. But, I have been lenient for first, first just few weeks, and then I used to, took off mark from them. I took off mark, like, 5%, 5, or, yeah, 5 to 8. Then they have…they have started acknowledging. So that… in that way, they have learned that this is the important part, okay? So, yeah, so I have… I have used that strategy. To make them acknowledge. And… What could be other? Maybe in the subject… I don't know, if my subject coordinator emphasized on… during the… the, class time, like, in the lecture, but I think we could, like emphasize it a bit more. In the subject content, or in the during the lecture, so that they… they will know that, okay, so this is the important thing. That could be one thing. Interviewer: Okay, so to summarize, you would say maybe emphasizing, the importance of acknowledging it appropriately during lectures could be one way, and the other way could be maybe more significant consequences for students, because they seem to work for you in…"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,17,"Yes. Yes. Interviewer: Okay, thank you. Next question. Interviewer: In your observation, did the use of generative AI tools influence student engagement, learning approaches, or assessment performance?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,18,"Okay, yes, yes. Yes, it definitely, it influenced, or it increased their performance. Like, if I compare, this semester with other semesters, then definitely the performance of these students, increased a lot. They have been doing very well in certain certain, contents or certain modules, in my previous experience when, they were not used GenAI, so I saw that some people, some students who are attending, who, prepared well for the tutorials, they do well, but the others, they don't… who just come to the tutorial and open the content and start learning and doing. So, this kind of… this type of… for those type of students, when they generate ideas, through the Gen AI, then, I would say the performance increased. A lot. But what I have, I have observed, like students who do well, like, who prepared well, who attend, lectures and tutorials, and also they… sometimes they take help from the GenAI, they have done excellent. Okay, but compared to students who relate just on GenAI, or they don't, like, attend, or they don't read the lectures and other materials, compared to them. So it's basically… the summary is, like, it is helpful for those students who are, like, prepared or who give effort. Interviewer: And in terms of student engagement, so during your tutorials, did you notice any difference? More engaged, less engaged, some students, or…"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,19,"Well… Because of… so… Because of the tool, yes, it, it, I think, yeah, yes, they have engaged, I would say it's a bit, like, yeah, 40%, maybe 30 to 40% more, more engagement. Interviewer: Because…"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,20,"other than… sometimes other students just don't do anything, they just sit and chit-chat with one another. But this time, especially for the tool, they just… at least they just generate something. Instead of just sitting… maybe they're playing with the tools. Interviewer: Okay."
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,21,"Yeah, that's how the, I would say, the engagement also increased a bit. Interviewer: Do you also have seen any negative impact through generative AI?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,22,"Yes, yes, I had one case, one… one group of students who use it overly, like, they just rely on GenAI, and they don't want to give much effort, they just generate and submit, that's it. Interviewer: So this student group is also not really participating much during class then, or…"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,23,"Yes, yeah, they don't actually much… they're not engaged. I… I have tried them to, make engaged, but yeah. First, there's… they initially do, and if I… I am away, then they just start again, so, yeah. Interviewer: Alright, thank you. Next question, Afifah. While marking, did you observe whether students were able to critically evaluate AI-generated content, or did they tend to rely on it without verification?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,24,"Well, yes, I… I would say, yeah, they have…they have that ability to, evaluate GenAI content. From our content, so it is very visible, like, they have to generate… they have to first make their own diagram, and then they have to generate one. So when they write reflection, I have noticed that they have… they have… they were able to, evaluate. Like, what the… what the tools, generated, and what was the problem, and how… how they will adopt the content, the generated things, or good things in their own diagrams, so I would say, yeah, they were able to particularly evaluate the content, general AI content. Interviewer: And that's for the majority, that's for all students or that's for some students?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,25,"Also 50%, so half of the students, they were able to critically evaluate, the other half not so much…actually, they don't even… I also got some students who even wrote the reflection with the tool. So, yeah, it's actually depends on students, like, if they are attentive, if they… again, it's, it's the, like, if they're… if they are willing to give effort.. Interviewer: And they do well with the tool? What if they just do for the sake of doing it, and.."
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,26,"yeah, that's how they misuse, or they don't pay much attention. They do… they used to do… even generate the reflection as well. Interviewer: And what strategies did you use to help your students develop evaluative judgment, if there's any?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,27,"Yes, so in that case, actually, we… I haven't, involved, in here that much, because Subject Coordinator-31269 used to tell us that don't, give much time on this task. Because, because we have, we, we have a lot of tasks for each tutorial, so if we, like, give much time… for, much time for these tasks, the students might end up with, like, not finishing all the tasks, so they might, like… so that's why we didn't give much time to help them, or to show them any strategy. But when students… for some groups… when I see the students are really engaged, they want to learn, they want to know, then I… I went there, or talked to them, like, how can they… how… how to give the prompt, or how they can, they can get the best result through the… through the prompt. Yeah, so some students feel, some students was complaining, okay, so if we want to generate diagrams through the GenAI, we have to… we have to give a lot of prompt, and that's… there's… that is another hassle. So, we don't want that. It is better to generate our own thing and own ideas.But for generating ideas and brain… brainstorming, or the analysis purpose of the case study, it was a good tool that… but for the… for generating the diagram or making the diagram, so GenAI was not good, according to the students. Interviewer: Okay. And for the 50% that you just described that didn't really critically reflect, and they just generated their reflection. Do you have any idea for future offerings, how to better support the development of students' critical evaluation in those cases?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,28,"I think we could have, content within the lecture…maybe that could be helpful for them to, like, how to, like, how to do that, yeah. Include… Interviewer: What kind of content would you suggest?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,29,"So, anything, like, how to use Gen AI, or how to get the best result through the GenAI. This kind of thing, maybe. Interviewer: Okay, thank you. Let's move on to the next question. Just copy and paste. Interviewer: To what extent were students aware of ethical guidelines for using generative AI in their assessments?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,30,"By now, I would say by now, they are really well aware, because, as I said, I used to cut marks, so…so I was in… during the tutorials, I used to always, tell them, okay, so this is the most important thing, you have to acknowledge it, as I was emphasized several times, so I think by now they… they are really aware that, okay, some, even some students, I got some students, they were hiding like, they… they don't want to show me, like, they have in using Gen AI, but when I ensure that, okay, you can use it, but you have to use it ethically. So, you have to acknowledge it, you can use it. So, that kind of insurance made them confident. So, by now, I think, yeah, I would say, yeah, they are…they are really aware of that. Interviewer: What strategies could maybe improve their understanding and application of these guidelines? It seems like…At the beginning of the semester, they weren't really aware of it, but it improved in the course of the semester, if I understood correctly. So, what strategies could maybe help to improve their understanding and the application of these guidelines from the very first moment?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,31,"Could you place, Say it again? Or maybe… What strategy? Interviewer: What strategies could improve the understanding and application of these ethical guidelines from the very start of the semester?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,32,"Okay, I would say I think they need to understand the purpose of using GenAI or integrating GenAI with their content. If they understand the purpose and the benefit, they will be serious on this matter, and they will incorporate GenAI, or they will use it, or if they can see the bigger picture of it, that could be one strategy. Interviewer: Okay, next question. Did you encounter an ethical… any ethical concerns? For example, over-reliance on AI, plagiarism, misuse of AI tools?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,33,"Yes, as I said earlier, I think one group they were really over-reliant on it, and I talked with my coordinator, and yeah, I think Subject Coordinator-31269 arranged a meeting with the students. And, but yeah, that's how we have, like, we approached the group, and… yeah. Interviewer: Any other cases of over relying?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,34,"Not really. Even I… some of the groups…who really do well, they don't even use Gen AI. So, when I asked them that why don't you… or how comfortable you are doing… you are using Gen AI, they said… they said that, okay, we feel like Gen AI is not very helpful for this subject, so it's better to do our task on our own. So they don't want to use it in any way. Interviewer: And for this one student group, do you have any idea how the subject could better address or prevent such issues in the future?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,35,"Which issue, sorry? Interviewer: The student group that was over-relying on generative AI, how could the subject better address or prevent such issues in the future?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,36,"Well, actually, I haven't think about that, maybe, there can be… if they are really engaged with the course, that could be one way. If they get the content interesting and, yeah, then maybe they will not rely on, the… the… the Gen AI… very much. Otherwise, I'm not sure, actually. Interviewer: Thank you, Afifa. Next question. How effective were the current subject guidelines and scaffolding activities and resources in promoting ethical and critical use of generative AI?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,37,"To me, it is effective, as long as students want to learn, they want to engage with the course, the, the design of this course, the outlines and the scaffolding activities, all are really interactive. And I feel like it's very, interesting, because each of the week, we learn different, students learn different diagrams and different techniques to analyse their real business problems. In that case, I think it is really effective, but…but in terms of promoting ethical and critical use of Gen AI, as"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,38,"this is the first time the subject started to integrate with GenAI. I think, for future, I'm expecting, like, if it is effective, or if the subject will continue to integrate with GenAI, it would be better to, like, to have more content or more focus on… within the content of the lecture. So that the students will know that this is a very, like, very important part of this course. So, the design of this current, like, in this, in this semester, it looks like it was an… not very much, like, an important part. But in future, if it is like that it is the most important part within the subject, then I think it will be more effective. Interviewer: So, giving generative AI some more space and room, right?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,39,"Right, right, right. Interviewer: Looking ahead, next question. Looking ahead, what improvements would you suggest for integrating generative AI tools more effectively into assessments and learning activities?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,40,"Yes, I would say there's the one… there's the same thing, I would say, giving more space, or… yeah. That's how we can, like… Interviewer: But maybe also thinking of how they were included now, in this semester into assessments and learning activities, so having those comparison tasks…"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,41,"Okay, so…yaybe I can ask… I can answer this question better if I know the purpose of integrating Gen AI in this course. Yeah, could you please, like, give me some idea, like, what is the purpose of… integrating Gen AI with this… in this course, maybe. Interviewer: The purpose? The purpose is obviously because the technology generative AI is out there, and… students use it, they have access to it, so…the approach is to actually give students officially the space to use it. But if they use it, they're supposed to use it… critically. And, because it's…it's most likely gonna be a skill that is required to have for students that graduate from university, that they are able to use those tools effectively. So…therefore, the purpose of including generative AI into certain subjects has to be to include it in such a way that it is effective. And that it supports student learning instead of taking it away. So if we look at this question, again, looking ahead, what improvements would you suggest for integrating generative AI tools more effectively into assessments and learning activities? This aims for looking back to the semester, and where the subject was, including those activities, intervention activities in week 5, 8, and 11, and also the way generative AI was part of assessments. Including acknowledgements, including reflections, including comparison activities. So, how can this be improved?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,42,"Well, okay, yeah. Yes, so I would say in that case, we need to assign some marks for the critical evaluation. Specifically, because when they will see that, okay, this part is really important, and it has marks, because students always motivated by getting marks, so if they see that it involves some marks, then they will be very… they will take it seriously. Because, yes, some mindset… some students, like that, as I said, they don't… they see the user-generated AI as a hassle, till now. So, to make them involved, or to make them, in, to make them involved with the Gen AI, we need… we need to assign some marks, especially for the big assessment. If they can, if we have some marks for them, or we have…Till now in this, in this semester… they don't have any Gen AI content or generated things for the week assessment. Any evaluation or critical evaluating, reflection, this kind of thing. We don't have it for the big assessment. We have… we had it just for three activities in… during the tutorial. So maybe we can, have a kind of task or a section for that in the big assessment. So that's how they will be more motivated. Interviewer: Okay, thank you. Next question. What types of resources, support, or professional development would be most valuable to help you as a tutor and other tutors, confidentially teach in AI-integrated subjects in the future?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,43,"Okay, so I think any kind of…Any kind of, session, like, Any kind of… Materials could be…any kind of… any kind of, I would say, what… how to, like…any kind of information, or any kind of session, especially for me, like, a new teacher, if I knew it before that… actually, I didn't even know that was the purpose of gen… using Gen AI, or what's the purpose of, like, integrating Gen AI with this course. I didn't even know that. So, yeah, so, yeah, some kind of information. Prior to the start of the semester. That could be a helpful for us. To convey the message clearly to the students, and to show the importance of it. That could be a helpful thing. Any kind of…thing, any, maybe any workshop, or any, any, any modules, or any learning modules, whatever it is. It could be helpful for us. Interviewer: Okay, great. Thank you, Afifah. And now we're moving on to the very last section, which is looking at the intervention activities in week 5, 8, and 11. And it's a quick, quick section, that we just need to get some information from the tutors, because they basically saw how students…experience those tutorials. So maybe you can just tell me a bit about the observed student enthusiasm in week 5, 8, and 11 for those inter… intervention activities. So, how was the room? How was…The energy of students during those intervention activities."
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,44,"Yes, that was, I think, yeah, it was an interesting part. Students were engaged, and they were, like…they were, very interested to generate the diagrams. They were trying in different ways, and they were playing with the tools. Yeah, and they also find, they were also, like…surprised to see the difference between the generated one and their original one. Yeah, it was quite engaging, and yeah. Interviewer: And what generative AI tools were mostly used by students?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,45,"Okay, so as, as in our course, there have been, like, in the tutorial documents, they were asked to use the… just Copilot. So, for that purpose, they had to use the Copilot, but I… I saw some students, they were not very happy with Copilot. So they're… they were saying, like. This is not a very great tool, so they want to use the other one, so yeah, but as the document has Copilot…just….so they had to use that one (Copilot). Interviewer: So mostly Copilot, and some…"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,46,"….but for generating text and other things. I saw many students who are using ChatGPT and I just go to one group, maybe, who used DeepSeek. Yeah, that's it. Interviewer: And was the objective of each intervention activity clear to students?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,47,"Yes, to… to see the difference, and what things they can adopt. From the generating one, where were they lacking, and yeah, these kind of things that were very obvious to them. Interviewer: So there was no confusion at any stage around those intervention activities, right?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,48,"No. Interviewer: No, okay. Interviewer: And, have you seen any student skill progression over those 3 weeks? So, from week 5 to week 8, from week 8 to week 11? Did you feel like student understanding and use of those tools improved, or they became quicker in doing those intervention activities?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,49,"Yeah, so, yeah, some students are quicker, they just, want to get it done. And some students were curious, yeah, they even saw in the last…in week 11, I would say one… I can remember one student came to me with different types of diagram. He was very, like, happy or very interested to show me that, look, I have generated these two, three kind of, diagrams. And he was, like, explaining the difference between the… between them and the original one. Yeah, so yeah, they have… the skill, I would say, yeah, it has improved as, for those students who are eager, actually, who are… who are willing to learn. Yeah. Interviewer: And there were any challenges that you encountered as a teaching staff during those intervention activities?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,50,Not really.
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,51,"Yeah, just I… I went… I went to the… around the table, and saying that, okay, some students that don't… I… I… I emphasized on including the prompt on the document… they don't even, like, like, giving much time on that. They just, copy the diagram and just put the diagram. They don't even give the prompt, so I was emphasizing to include the prompt as well. Yeah, some students, they don't want to spend much time on giving a proper prompt, they just say that, okay, generate this diagram. I… I used to ask them what… what did you say, like, when to generate the diagram? They used to say that, okay, I just give this one, just the case study, and generate the diagram, that's it. Interviewer: Okay, so a few students, they lacked in motivation, but majority was quite engaged during those intervention activities, right?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,52,Right. Yeah. Interviewer: Okay. Interviewer: And did anything change in your teaching strategies? Did you learn anything about guiding students in using generative AI during those sessions?
tutor,31269,Spring,Second,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,53,"Yes, yes, I have learned a lot, actually, yeah. So, some students, I was surprised, like, some students were, were very critical, give the prompt, and, how they reflect on that… how they identify the things they can adopt from, from the generated diagrams. So, yeah, these kind of things, it was enlightening for me as well. Interviewer: Okay, beautiful. Interviewer: That's it, Afifa. Thank you so much for all the time, and… your…thought power to just think about all those questions. I really appreciate that you took this time and…"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P02,SPR-P02,1,"Interviewer: So I'm just gonna record this session for data analysis purposes, but, everything will be anonymized, so your name won't appear. I hope that's okay."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,2,"Yeah, yeah. Okay, fine. Interviewer: Amazing. Interviewer: Maybe just to start with, I'll give you a quick introduction of what this whole study's about, so…basically, this interview now happens because we want to reflect on your experience teaching in an AI-integrated subject, like BRM31269, which you're tutoring, and we will explore your familiarity with generative AI tools, how they were used and observed. During the semester, through you, and also through students. And your thoughts on student engagement, ethical concerns, and the support provided through the subject, subject coordinator, and also the university. And this study is part of the first and further year experience class, which means it is looking at first-year students at university. And this study aims to understand how students engage with AI-integrated assessments, how they develop evaluative judgment skills for learning. And, also how they reflect. The ultimate goal of our research is, based on our findings to get insights that help shape future assessment strategies, and also to improve future curriculums of subjects that integrate AI, like 31269. And it's, specifically focused on BIS courses at UTS. So that's kind of, like, the broad overview of…the research study, and also why I'm interviewing you today."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,3,"Yeah, okay. Interviewer: Do you have any questions before we jump into the questions that I have prepared?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,4,"No, just one question. During the tutorial sessions…we have one question regarding to, for example, generate these diagrams with the help of the AI. We only, in this session, we only focus on that part of the tutorials. This is the only goal of this meeting, to talk about that session? Interviewer: No, that’s not the only part of the day… you're talking about the intervention activities, right? In week 5, and 11."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,5,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Interviewer: Not only this, but also looking a bit more general, like, also maybe on the… into the assignments that were conducted. But yeah, it's also part of it. The intervention activities… we will talk about your, experience around those intervention activities at the end, but we will start with a couple questions first, okay?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,6,"Yeah, yeah, okay. Interviewer: Amazing. So I will just pop all the questions into the chat, one after the other, so you can also read them in the chat, which makes it maybe easier for you to follow along… So let's maybe just start straight away with the first question, and the first question is lookin into your experience. So, what was your level of familiarity with generative AI tools before teaching this subject?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,7,"Actually, I use generative AI every day, I think. For different purposes. But most of them, I've used the generative AI for… mmm… Summarizing and, for example, proof, or.. polish some emails or some statements. Interviewer: What tools specifically are you using?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,8,"And… Which Gen AI, you mean? Or which… ChatGPT, most of them, ChatGPT. Interviewer: Okay."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,9,Yep. Interviewer: So you would say your familiarity is quite high?
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,10,"Yeah, yeah. Interviewer: Yeah. You already answered parts of the next question, which I just posted in the chat. How frequently do you use generative AI tools? You were saying daily, in your professional work…You were already mentioning some of the use cases, but maybe also looking at teaching, research, and administration separately. Can you maybe elaborate a bit further on the use cases of generative AI?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,11,"Yes, I use generative AI in different purposes."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,12,"For example, for my teaching sessions..,before each classes, I… mmm…search with the generative AI to be familiar with the subject to go more in depth of the subject. And also, I asked GenAI to give me some possible questions that the students might ask me during the session about this subject. And, also for my research, I try to find the definitions of different parts of my research, and also , whenever I search for research publications. And if I don't understand what some parts of that research article, so the GenAI, can help me to understand. And, also, it helped me to save lots of time. Interviewer: All right, great, thank you so much for those insights. Next question: Prior to the subject, so 31269, did UTS provide you with any training, resources, or support on the ethical use of generative AI in education?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,13,"Actually, yes, we have two courses.The… at the first and second semester of the PhD, and I remember in one of them, we learned about the ethical use of the Gen AI and also, some online courses in the UTS websites that we should do before getting access. I think one of them was regarding the ethical use of the GAI. So, yes, I think we have…do some plenty of courses regarding AI. Interviewer: Is there maybe any additional support or training that you would like to see being offered in the future?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,14,"I think it might be helpful, yes, if they only focus on the Gen AI, because when we do some ethical, courses, it covers all parts of the research that relate to the ethical, but if we can have only focus on the GenAIs…for instance they have a course especially for using the Gen AI, how we can use it, how we… and for how much we can, get the data from the GenAI…I think it might be helpful, yes. Interviewer: So just to better understand, the courses you were describing as part of your PhD, they were ethics in general, and part of it was about generative AI, but not solely about generative AI, right?."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,15,"Yes, yes. Interviewer: Okay. Thank you. Nice, next question. How did you integrate generative AI into your teaching or assessment feedback during this subject?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,16,"I use GenAI, as I mentioned before, before the class. I talked with the Gen AI to… regarding the subject of each tutorial before the class… and after I…give some… enough information to the Gen AI that it knows what's going to be happening in my classes, and what's my role, and how the class is going to be. So after that, I can simulate the class before my tutorial sessions. So, I, for example, I asked GenAI to assume you are one of my students, so you can ask me questions."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,17,"Which parts you… you think it's tricky, or which parts you… it might be confusing and… and also give me some, possible answers. So… it can be helpful to… preparing myself before each tutorial classes. So I… yes, I use GenAI before each of my tutorial sessions and each of the teaching sessions. And, I think it's really helpful for me. Interviewer: And in regards to assessment feedback?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,18,"assessment feedback, what do you mean by the assessment feedback? Interviewer: So, providing feedback for assessments, for assignments, student assignments, did you also use Generative AI for that?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,19,"Yes, of course, I'm… It might… it's helpful to give students the feedback regarding their assignments. Yeah, I use GenAI for both teaching and assessment feedback. Interviewer: All right, thank you for sharing. Since you're using generative AI quite a lot for your teaching, is there any challenges in incorporating generative AI into your teaching or assessments? Do you see any challenges?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,20,"Yes, the main challenge is how to ask Gen AI your problem because it's very sensitive to your prompts. So, the way that you ask your question is really important, because the GenAI might give you different answers. So… and it is really important to know how to ask the Gen AI to give you the correct answer. Also, in some parts, you should double-check your answers. With, maybe searching in the Googles or other resources to make sure that this answer is correct. So these are the challenges. One is…to the reliability of the answers, another one is, to know how to ask the GenAI your questions. Interviewer: And now, thinking about the way 31269 integrated generative AI into the assignments. Do you see any challenges around this?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,21,"Yes, the challenge, is… different groups, gave different answers and they… they didn't try to give the best answer from the… Gen AI and after they use their first prompt to… give some answers from the GenAI, and then that's finished. If we can add some details on it to… try to…try to generate the best answer that you can to, the Gen AI, I think it would be better, because…as I said, is really sensitive to… the way…that we're asking the Gen AI. So, it's really important how we can try to find the best possible answer or not. Interviewer: So students were kind of, like, escaping this comparison activity? By just entering the most simple prompt to just get it out of the way?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,22,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Interviewer: So you think this… stronger guidance needed in terms of how they should interact with the generative AI tool, or more restrictions around it, so maybe providing certain steps they should include when prompting?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,23,"Yes, of course. I, I think, maybe we can, have, maybe we can give them one prompt that we, we tried, that it gives the good answer. So we can try it before the class, that this prompt, if you give the GenAI these statements, they give you the good answers, so this is the template for the prompts. And then asked the students, to find the answers better than this from the AI. So they can try to find the better prompts better than we suggest them. I think maybe this is one solution that we can take. Interviewer: Alright, thank you for sharing. Next question, in your observation, did the use of generative AI tools influence student engagement, learning approaches, or assessment performance? So maybe elaborate on both, like, positive and negative impacts of generative AI tools. Looking at student engagement, learning approaches, or assessment performance."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,24,"Yes, I think it… It's kind of engaging, but not too much, not very much. But I think it needs more improvement in terms of if we want students, to engage. It needs more improvement. Because, as I said, they only try to generate, the simple one. And it takes, I think, maybe…maximum 5 minutes for them to generate one diagram. So, if we want to engage them, we can add more tests regarding this. For example, if they can, try to find the best possible answers from the gen AI. They will be more engaged. And also, they learn how to use the GenAI, and they see the sensitivity of their prompts and a sentence that they give to Gen AI. So, I think, It's good, but it needs improvement to make the students more engaged with. Interviewer: And in terms of assessment performance and learning approaches? Did you observe any change any influence through Genitive AI?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,25,"In terms of learning approaches, it's really good. Because, they can know the definitions of the subjects and tasks. And, I think in this part, it's really good, the learning approach. Interviewer: That's also what you saw in your class?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,26,"Yes. Yeah. But regarding the assessment performance, I didn't observe any improvement of assessment performance."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,27,"And, you mean to try to… Compared their answers to the GenAI answers, when they want to compare? Interviewer: No, did their assessment performance improve, or not compared, maybe, to last semester, where generative AI was not integrated into this subject…"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,28,"I didn't see any changes between the last semester and this semester in this part. Yeah, but in the learning approaches, yes, of course, there's some changes. Interviewer: Alright, thank you for sharing. Next question. While marking, did you observe whether students were able to critically evaluate AI-generated content? Or did they tend to rely on it without verification?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,29,"Hmm… Some of them did, but some of them not. Some students try to critically evaluate the AI generated and… try to compare then their answers with the Gen AI and they try to critically evaluate. But ny observation was that the students that get the best answers from the GenAI, they also, write more critical evaluation between their answers and the GenAI. So, I think these are, mostly, depends on the students. Yes, in some cases, I… sawthat they try to evaluate their AI-generated content, but in some cases, no, I didn't. Interviewer: Would you say the majority is the ones that, do critically evaluate, or the majority is the students that don’t?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,30,"I think it's good to say 50-50. Yeah, half of the students try to critically evaluate, and half of them not. Interviewer: Okay, thank you. It's also interesting what you shared, that you were saying it kind of goes hand-in-hand with more experience…using generative AI, generating better prompts goes hand-in-hand with also more critically evaluation."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,31,"Yeah, yeah. Interviewer: Good, interesting. Thank you so much for sharing, for this answer. A question that relates to the last question quite strongly is, what strategies did you use to help them develop evaluative judgment, if there are any?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,32,"One of the strategies is to invite one group that did very well in terms of the evaluate and generating one answer, to invite them to present their work in the class to all students. And also, I told them to share the prompt: What… what did you, say to the Gen AI to generate this one. So after that the other groups, see that. The students said that… we could generate better answers from the GenAI, as this group, did. So, my strategy is to invite one group to present their work. This is the main strategy. And also, I'm going to their desk and talk with them regarding the AI generated and just give them the feedback that…if you have any time, you can do another one, because I believe that you can generate the better answer from it. Interviewer: Thank you for sharing, Amir. Next question, to what extent were students aware of ethical guidelines for using generative AI in their assessments?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,33,"Actually, I don't know the answer of this question. The… how… to what extent the students are aware? But I know that they know that they cannot generate the answers from the GenAI, but I don't know other parts of the ethical that they learn or not. But actually, it is obvious that all the students or most of the students use the GenAI to answer the questions. But to what extent they are aware the ethical of the AI? I don't know, actually. Interviewer: In 31269, students were supposed to mention their use of generative AI in their assessments, right?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,34,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes… But of course, they can say, we don't use generative AI but… because there's no any proof that you can show to them this is generated from the AI or not, and there is no reliable source that shows you that this is generated with the AI or not. But… yeah, they acknowledge it. But, I don't know if it's correct or not, so… yeah, the only thing that we can rely on it, it's this part. Did you use any generative AI? Yes or no? Interviewer: Do you have any strategies in mind that could improve the student understanding and application of ethical guidelines?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,35,"The only strategy, I think, is to… changing that, questions of tutorial sessions. The questions can be changed, for example, when we face one question that has a picture on it, so it's really hard to get answer from the Gen AI. But if we have some simple multiple choice, we can copy and paste it into Gen AI and give some answers or if we have one, for example, question regarding one video, video clip, So, it's hard to find the answers from the Gen AI, because it should be related to that video clip. So, I think the only way that I can suggest is to change maybe changing questions. Yep. Interviewer: Alright, thank you for sharing. Did you encounter any ethical concerns, for example, over-reliance on AI, plagiarism, misuse of AI tools?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,36,"My only ethical concerns is…the groups that use Gen AI to generate the answers might get higher marks rather than other groups that takes more effort than the group that has generated AI. Mmm, this is the only, the only concern. Because, of course, yeah, because, of course, in some cases, Gen AI gives you better answers. Interviewer: So you haven't seen in your class of… when looking at the assignment submissions, weekly submissions, any over-reliance on AI from students, or any plagiarism, or any misuse of AI tools?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,37,"No plagiarism and no misuse of AI tools. I didn't see these ones. But, my only concerns regarding the, ethical use of the Gen AI is if some students use the GenAI to generate the answer this student might get higher marks rather than the students that don't use the GenAI and, of course… do much more effort, rather than the other students. So this is my only concerns that the marks would be changed if they use, and if they don't use. Interviewer: How could the subject better address or prevent such issues in the future?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,38,"So, I didn't think about it, to give you some possible solutions. But, but I saw this during my classes, not only in this subject, also in other subjects, for example, during the quizzes, of course, some students use Gen AIs…We can be more restrict in the class to go under their desk and watching their laptops, but I don't think this solution would be good. I think we should try to find another solution, rather than interacting with them to do not use this AI, or making some penalties, or something like this. But this is the main concerns. The students that use GenAI get better marks. Yep. Interviewer: Alright. Thank you for sharing. Next question, how effective were the current subject guidelines, scaffolding activities, and resources in promoting ethical and critical use of generative AI?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,39,"I think this course, these parts of the course that ask them to generate one answer with the AI is really good because, when we told them to generate one answer with the A…so, they try to do their best in terms of, answering the tasks by themselves. And also, they can learn so many things regarding the AI answers, and then improve their works. Thet might be lose something or missed something in their assessment/assignments so they can go back to their answers and modify their answers based on the AI generated. I think, this…Let me double check the questions conformity to the resource in the prompt and chat. Yeah, okay, yeah, so overall, yeah, it's effective to using GenAI…the ethical use of Gen AI in this course. Interviewer: Also, the guidelines that are provided on Canvas?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,40,"Hmm… yes. As it is, the guidelines, I think it's fine. But if we're going to change the tasks regarding the GenAI, of course, the guideline needs modification as well. Yeah, but as it is, it's good. Interviewer: Thank you for sharing. Next question, looking ahead, what improvements would you suggest for integrating generative AI tools more effectively into assessments and learning activities?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,41,"Try to put some questions, some basic questions regarding the subject and topic of the session, for example, the topic is, for instance, use case narratives, draw use case narratives. My suggestion is to put 3-4 questions regarding the basic definition of the use case narratives, and ask them to ask these questions from the Gen AI and read the answers, and put the answers in your tests. The questions can be like this. What's the purpose of the use case narratives? What's the structure of the use case? Only the basics of the subject, because in this case, they're forced to learn the definition of the subject. Of course, this is… useless for the students can read, lectures, materials. But we all know that some students just come into class to do some tasks, and that's finished. They don't try to learn what they're going to do, and what's the purpose of these tasks. So, if we put some basic questions regarding the definitions of the tasks and the subject. So, I think we're going to teach them and to know what they are going to do in this tutorial session. Interviewer: Alright, thank you for sharing. This is the last question now, before we look into the intervention activities. What types of resources, support, or professional development would be most valuable to help you as an academic tutor, or a tutor confidently teach in AI-integrated subjects in the future?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,42,"I think for me, just if they can give me the access to the Gen AI's, the premium one, the premium version of the Gen AIs, if I can have… if I can get access to the premium version. So I have, Indefinite prompts. So, it would be better. So, I, I don't know, what other resource or support they can give, to help… yeah, the only thing that I can suggest is this one. Yeah, to access material. Interviewer: So Copilot, you have access to, or I think that's the premium version, or is there a different version for Copilot?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,43,"I… actually, I didn't try the Copilot. Mostly, I used ChatGPT. Interviewer: And thinking about… Professional development in terms of in-person sessions? To educate teaching staff on using generative AI tools could be helpful as well, or not really, because you're already quite familiar with it?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,44,"Of course, for some tutors, it might be helpful and it only depends on the materials of that, sessions and meetings but for me, I don't know if anything can… might be helpful during those sessions. I should see the materials of the interactions and resources to see if they might be helpful or not. If they are just going to mention the basics of the generative AI, so I don't think it might be very helpful for me, yeah. Interviewer: All right, thank you for sharing, Amir. Now we come to the last part of this interview, and it's about the observational data around the intervention activities, so maybe you can tell me just a bit about the observed student enthusiasm during week 5, 8, and 11 classes. Thinking about those intervention activities."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,45,"Oh, okay. Yes, it actually… I mean, in some cases, I see some enthusiasm but some of them are really interested to generate some answers with the AI, and something like this…and also, I invite these kinds of students to present. But, in some cases, no, I didn't see any difference. So, as before, I should say even maybe 50% or half of the students are engaged, yeah, engaged and interested, and some of them are not. Interviewer: What generative AI tools were used by students? Copilot, ChatGPT…"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,46,"Both. ChatGPT and Copilot is the most one. And… Yeah, I think they mostly use these two. Interviewer: And was the objective of each of the intervention activities clear to students?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,47,"Yes, the objectives, I think, are clear. Because it's mentioned in their… tests that… write the reflection. What is the difference between your answers and the AI ones. So I think it's clear, yeah. Interviewer: Were there any challenges that you encountered in those weeks? Week 5, 8, and 11? Maybe because of technical, issues, or maybe because of conceptual issues, or motivational?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,48,"Yes, only one challenge that some students said that we try to generate the answers, but the AI gives us the coding and not the diagram. I think that's not a big challenge, but I saw several cases, something like this, and I told them to ask it to generate one diagram instead of giving you the code of the diagram. This is the only… Interviewer: Did you see any student skill progression over those 3 weeks? So, was there a difference between week 5 to 8, week 8 to 11? So was it easier for students, maybe, to do those intervention activities? Was there any growth? A personal growth of students."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,49,"I should check…check their answers from, for example, and compare their answers from week 5… week 1 to 5, and that..but I think…the change is that some students find out that the GenAI gives them some details that they missed in their answers, so they go back to their answers and modify their, answers. So, I think, yes, these parts, it's helpful and effective for them. Interviewer: Great. Thank you for sharing. And one last sub-question. How did your own teaching strategies evolve? So, what did you learn about guiding students in using generative AI tools responsibly or critically? Basically your own learning."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,50,"You mean my own learning in terms of guiding students? Interviewer: Yes, when it comes to using generative AI tools."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P03,SPR-P03,51,"Yeah, the only thing is, see different answers, and try to find the, for example, algorithm of the GenAI, how would the GenAI answers to some if you use some words in your prompts…how the Gen AI answers to you. So, this is, the way that I… this is… this is the thing that I learned during these classes when we interact with different, submissions when I see different submissions, I try to find what's the difference between these? Because they use the same Gen AI, but they give… they take out different answers. So I tried to find out what kind… what kind of words gives you the better answers. 31269 Spring – Fourth Tutor Interview Interviewer: I hope it's okay for you that I will record this session for data analysis purposes."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,52,"Yeah, no problem. Interviewer: No problem, beautiful. I don't know if you have seen already my email that I was sending you about the consent form. I think I haven't received the signed consent form yet. Maybe if you could just send it to me after the interview, would be really nice."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,53,"Okay, yep, I will do that. Interviewer: Amazing. Yeah, today's session is mainly to reflect on your experience teaching in an AI-integrated subject, like 31269, and we tried to explore your familiarity with generative AI tools, and how they were used or observed during the semester, and your thoughts on student engagement, ethical concerns, and the support provided by UTS, provided by the subject. And so on. And, this study, and also the interview, is part of the first and further year experience grants. That's why 31269 is also part of it, because it's a first-year subject, and this study aims to understand how students engage with AI-integrated assessments, and how they start to develop an evaluative judgment skill for learning and reflection. So, the very ultimate goal of it is to create, based on our insights, or to help based on our insights, shape future assessment strategies, and, improve curriculums in BIS courses at UTS. Yes, that's kind of, like, the main, scope of this research, and also what this interview will be about."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,54,Alright. Interviewer: Do you have any questions before we start with the interview questions?
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,55,"Actually, you know, I have, a course with, under the coordination of Subject Coordinator-31269 and, in the course, we had several tasks for students to use generative AI and we asked the student to have two activities, to perform a task based on their own knowledge, and also they ask the GenAI tools to provide some information and answer to the task, alternatively, so our experience in BIS course, was in this scope. You know. We asked the students to do the job in two, in two ways, using their own knowledge, and also ask the Gen AI to respond to this question, and they, they try to compare these two outputs, together. Yeah. Interviewer: Yeah, I know. That's why this, that's why we selected you as a teaching staff for this subject, because."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,56,"Okay. Interviewer: 31269. Subject Coordinator-31269’s subject is part of this, research, FFYE grant research."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,57,"I see. Interviewer: Okay. I will always just copy and paste the questions also into the chat, so you can read them at the same time. Makes it maybe a bit easier for you as well. So maybe let's just start with the first question. And the first question is. What was your level of familiarity with generative AI tools before teaching this subject?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,58,"As a matter of fact, I am a researcher in this field, and I'm doing some research in different aspects of Gen AI. I'm running LLMs, I'm running several tools to… from scratch, to implement, our idea in gen AI and the application of gen AI in other fields. So I know the basics of the Gen AI. Interviewer: Any specific tools that you use regularly?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,59,"Yeah, I'm working with, several LLMs. I'm using, RAG technology. RAG means Retrieval Augmented, Generation, it helps the, it helps LLMs to reply better to. To have… better reasoning and for example, I use Olama, I use, Llama, LLM, I use, mixed straw and mixed straw LLMs and also, I have installed several Docker components for LLMs, and also, we are using several platforms to run the LLMs and connect the RAG technology into LLM. Interviewer: Okay. Then maybe let's move on to the next question. How frequently do you use those LLMs? And, for what professional work? For teaching, administration, research, I guess research a lot?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,60,"Research, most of the time, I use Gen AI for different aspects of my work. Interviewer: Do you have maybe some examples for each of them, for teaching?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,61,"Yeah, especially for my research, especially, let's start from the, let's start from my research. For my research, I, perform, coding, scripting, use Python, for example, for several tools. And, most of the time, when I come across, two errors or some unknown situations, I will use GenAI to get some quick response, for the error or any problem in the code. And for teaching most of the time when I provide a text, at least, in terms of English and improving the English of the text, I use GenAI. And some of the time, I try to use GenAI to categorize content, to provide, content. You know, make it more readable…I use Gen AI. Interviewer: So it sounds like almost on a daily or weekly base, there's some."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,62,"Daily, daily, daily basis. Interviewer: Amazing. Alright, next question. Prior to this subject, 31269, had UTS provided you with any training, resources, or support on the ethical use of generative AI in education?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,63,"Yes. We had this, I think, I have passed two courses, from UTS which were compulsory. Yeah, yeah, I had two courses…Gen AI something. I don't remember the name exactly, but it was about the Gen AI. Explaining about Gen AI, ethics, about the Gen AI, so on and so forth. Interviewer: Was it, like, an online course, or?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,64,"Online course, yeah online courses. Interviewer: So what additional support or training would you maybe like to see offered in the future, apart from this online course that you took, the two online courses?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,65,"I use… I got familiar with UTS policies regarding Gen AI.. For future, I do not remember anything more about it. It was very general. It was very general. You can find it in the UTS website. It is… this course is running for all of the staff and the students as well. Interviewer: Next question. Interviewer: How did you integrate generative AI into your teaching or assessment feedback during this subject? 31269"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,66,"Into my teaching, or…What was the next? Into my teaching, or… Interviewer: assessment feedback?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,67,"Assessment feedback. Assessment feedback. Yeah, for the teaching, as I told you, I have used generative AI for different aspects of teaching, especially for summarization of the content, for categorizing the content, for… improve the readability of the content, because English is not my native language, so sometime I provide the content, but I give it to Generative AI to make it more readable and be more native. And, also, sometime, most… for example, in programming course, not just in, BRM (31269) course…most of the students use GenAI to, provide scripting and codes for their tasks and I give the task to Gen AI to make sure that I know… I am familiar with the output of the students, because for sure, sometimes 100% or 90% students use Gen AI to do programming tasks. So, I also use the GenAI to make sure that I am familiar with the outputs that come from Gen AI. So it helps me to understand, how is the output of a student. Who perform the task..Himself, or herself? In comparison to the students who just, reflect the output of the GenAI. Yeah, this is the reason why I'm using GenAl… for performing a task. It helps me to, identify those students who are working on their own, not using just Gen AI. Interviewer: And maybe for the feedback, the written feedback that you provide, do you also use generative AI to maybe polish it up, or…"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,68,"Sometime, sometime, yeah. For example, sometime if, I want to provide a standard and similar, reflect to all students…I provide my example/my answer to the GenAI, I give it, my answer. And also give the student answer to compare my answer to the answer. And it helps me to make sure that the students have considered different aspects of the response, you know? Yeah, sometimes. If the context is very complex, and I have to check several, part of the response…I use the GenAI. Interviewer: Alright, thank you. Next question. In your opinion, what were the most significant challenges in incorporating generative AI into your teaching or assessments? Anything that you can recall around challenges?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,69,"Challenges. You know, Gen AI, will not provide, similar response. If, if you ask the same question, several times. And, it is very important that you check the output of Gen AI with the facts. Sometimes it provides you some fake information, some information that will not available in real world… I mean, but if you trust on the output, you will evaluate or give some erroneous feedbacks to the students. So it is very important, when you use Gen AI, you check the output of Gen AI with the text, with other websites, even with other Gen AI tools. You know? So, it is a serious mistake. If you trust to the output of the GenAI, and do not research for: other search tools, or other Gen AI tools, you have to check the output with context, with some textbooks, with some papers, to make sure that this output is okay. If you are using, the Gen AI for a specialized course, such as BRM or any other course. Interviewer: And thinking about the way 31269 included generative AI into their assessments, or even, like, into the tutorial activities, where students had to generate content with generative AI and compare, do you see any challenges around this? The way the subject incorporated generative AI?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,70,"Yeah, you know, most of, when, when you use GenAI, GenAI, most of the time provides some answer much better than the student's output. You know? But, when you ask the students…give the task to the GenAI and compare the output of Gen AI with yours, some students ask the Gen AI to provide very simple answer to the question. It is, it is quite easy. You can ask the general idea. It provides this content, from the perspective of a very, rudimentary or very elementary student. So, students, do this purposely because they want to show that their answer has been much better than the Gen AI. So, it was a challenge for me. I asked the student, yeah, ask the GenAI and compare your output with the GenAI output. The student asked the GenAI to provide some very simple answer for this question. So, yeah, you see that they have used GenAI, but the GenAI answer is very elementary, is very simple, but it is not real. If they ask the Gen AI, without any, manipulation on the prompt…they will ask very, smart and very, professional answer from the GenAI. So, a student do this manipulation on the prompts to show that they are… the student answer has been better than the GenAI. Interviewer: How could this challenge be better addressed, maybe in future offerings?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,71,"For future… maybe you, you, you can provide some standard prompts for the students. It means that, yeah, ask the question, using this template. Do not… do not do any manipulation on the prompt. So, it puts it in your controlled way of using GenAI, because their students, cannot manipulate, or you can ask them to share the link of the conversation with you, to make sure that, yeah, there is no manipulation in the prompt. Anyway, students are very smart, and they will change the way of communicating with generalized tools so… so…they can show, their response to this task, has been very better than the GenAI, you know? They are naughty. Interviewer: Okay, thank you for those insights. Next question. In your observation, did the use of generative AI tools influence student engagement, learning approaches."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,72,"Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I have seen that students, sometimes are being shocked for using, GenAI and the output of Gen AI. And, there are several aspects of this observation. There are some positives, and there are some negative aspects. From the positive side, yeah, students will receive several, professional answer to the question and they are not being stopped on a step because they don't have enough information. They, they just, just, filling a message into Gen AI and receive some professional answer for their question. It is very good. But, the negative aspect is that, students will not try to understand the topic. They are not…They are not… when everything is easy access, so they avoid thinking about the topic, just send the information and the task to the GenAI and receive the reply, and try to manipulate the response to show that, yeah, this response is from mine, not from their GenAI. Unfortunately, this, these, view, to generate is very awfulf because it's…you know, students avoid any, reasoning, any, thinking about a topic or a task…just try to customize it, to show that, yeah, this is my answer, and I have provided some professional answer to this question. So… Some kinds of monitoring, some kinds of control is required for these kinds of behaviours. Interviewer: And in terms of assessment performance, did you see any change?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,73,"Assessment? What do you mean by the assessment? Do you mean the final exam, or… Interviewer: Assessment performance, I mean the different assignments in the course of those 12 weeks."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,74,"Yeah, yeah, actually my response… the focus of my response was on the assignments, on the task, on the weekly tasks. Yeah, most of the time, students use Gen AI without any thinking. If you ask the question, some questions about the task, you will see that the students are not able to respond it truly. You know? Just… some of them… you will see, yeah, the task is very proficient, the answer is very good but when you ask the students about the detail of the answer, they do not… even know the concept of the course. I, I have, I have seen it in programming course. Students provide you with a very professional answer but, when you ask about what is this line? What is… for example, what this piece of code does? and they… they are not able to provide… I know, they are not able to provide you with very simple answer. They're similar for the BRM course. Yeah, but the BRM course is a group-based activity, so it is good and bad. Sometimes the whole group have an implicit agreement on using GenAI, so, their answer is just GenAI-based, they are not…they don't have any discussion, they don't have any communication for this task. They just, divide the task… I mean, escalate the task, and each part of the task is done by the Gen AI, by different students in the group. Interviewer: So would say, also, in terms of student engagement during tutorials, that's noticeable in a negative way?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,75,"Yeah, yeah, in some cases, the whole group do the same and use Gen AI for different parts of the task…so, if you ask them, if you ask them. How have you done this part? What is the meaning of this concept? What is the meaning of that concept? They are not able to provide the right answer to you. Interviewer: All right, thank you for sharing. Next question. You already answered parts of this question, but let's look at it just from a different angle again. While marking, did you observe whether students were able to critically evaluate AI-generated content? Or did they tend to rely on it without verification? So, obviously there's differences in students, I guess, but maybe you can talk about the majority and the minority, from this perspective. How critically evaluated, how critically did students evaluate AI-generated content?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,76,"For me, to make a decision about the behaviour of the students, I ask some question about the concept of the course…for example, when I see this response, it's very, it is very professional, so I ask some question about this task, and about the answer, and I ask the students some concept about the course, you know? And it is easy to understand whether or not they have provided this response themselves, or it is the response from Gen AI. Sometimes, sometimes it doesn't matter if you see, a student has used Gen AI, if they know the concept of the course, if they… if they understand what they have done by Gen AI, and if…any student is able to interpret the output of the Gen AI, so it is cool, no problem. But, I have seen several times that students are not able to answer very simple questions, but they provide very proficient answer to the task or to the questions. So… Yeah, it is the negative aspects of using GenAl from a student's part. And, at this moment, there is no way to control this behavior. Interviewer: But would you say what you observed while marking student assignments was that students, the majority of students were able to actually critically evaluate the AI-generated content, or it was a minority of students that was actually able to critically evaluate AI-generated content for…"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,77,"It depends on the group and the students in the group. Sometimes the students in a group are… most of them are very powerful in terms of reasoning and in terms of understanding, so they use just Gen AI for helping them in providing quick answer to the question, but they understand, how to use the Gen AI, and also they understand, and they are able to interpret it. But, if the students in the group are not collaborative, they are not able to communicate with each other. Some of them are freeriders, you know? So, they, they use the Gen AI to just, submit the course, just submit the task or assignments, and they are not able to understand the output, and they are not able to interpret the response of the Gen AI. So, actually, it depends on the course, and it depends on the group. I, I'm again, emphasize that in, programming course which is, very difficult for students, who are in their first year of University. I can say that, more than 80% of the students use GenAI to provide the answer to the questions and they provide very professional, response for programming tasks, for example. And you… you will be shocked, wow, how… how you have used… how you have provided such a professional, answer. But if you ask. No, response from students about… even they don't know the concept of the course. But, for… for the courses, the students are in group, I can say that, yeah, using the GenAI in a right manner is better. Because the group, should come on an agreement to use GenAI for all aspects of the course. So, yeah, the group base courses are better because the students cannot make a personal decision on using GenAI, but still, there are groups that all the students in the group use GenAI without understanding the response of the GenAI. Interviewer: And do you have any strategies that you use to help those students to develop better evaluative judgment?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,78,"My strategy is… Asking, the concepts… of the course, And when the students feel that you will ask about the concepts, so, they try to understand the genuine output. You know, it is very important, even they use GenAI, doesn't matter if they understand the concepts, if they are able to interpret the output of Gen AI, so it is cool, no problem for me. But as students… when students have a feeling of, being asked about their answer, so they will try to, inspect about the output of Gen AI. Interviewer: Right. Thank you for the answer. Next question. To what extent were students aware of ethical guidelines for using generative AI in their assessments?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,79,"Subject Coordinator-31269 asked the students to provide some contents, for example, provide the links or the screenshots of the general output to make sure that the students, understand, how should be the output of Gen AI, and how they are able to use the output of Gen AI. But… there is a standard part at the end of each task for the BRM course, about the GenAI, but most of the students even do not read this content at the end of the assignment, so even they are losing mark, because they are not customizing this template, this standard template for their answer. But still, they do not provide right information for the answer. So, every week, I ask the students, yeah, make sure that you are customizing this template for your output. You know, it is not fair if you feel, when there is a huge mark for, for generative AI, you see, for example, if the task has 100 marks. So, 20 of, this…task is… sorry, 20 marks, has been allocated for this task. So, what should I do? For example, if I see that a student has not filled out this section, so I have to reduce, for example, 10 out of 20, for this task. So, you know, from the coordinator view, the coordinator tried to, force students to get familiar with the Gen AI and ethics of Gen AI, but I'm not pretty sure that it is effective for their students. Interviewer: Do you have maybe different strategies?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,80,"We try to control this behaviour by reducing or increasing the marks and it's not really working that well. Yeah, I think it is not working at all. We asked the student to fill up a template, and they do this sometimes, and but I'm pretty sure that the output is not correct. For example, they are mentioning that, yeah, we have not used Gen AI. But I'm sure that they have used GenAI. The answer, the format of the answer, the output of the figures show that it is not provided by the student. I'm pretty sure, but they have mentioned that, no, we have not used any Gen AI tools…so, it is not effective.. Interviewer: Do you have any strategies in mind that could improve this situation, and also their understanding and application of these guidelines?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,81,"Maybe, maybe… it is very difficult, it is very difficult, but… because… because students, avoid mentioning that they have used GenAI, so, it is very difficult to understand. Yeah, actually, if, if you…if you ask them to use GenAI…very similar to… to the task that Subject Coordinator-31269 did in the assignments, you can ask the student, do this yourself, and do this by GenAI, and compare the outputs and provide the link of the GenAI output. Share the link. So… it helps them to, yeah, use the Gen AI…provide their output, compare them, and also share the output of Gen AI to make sure that they have used a standard template in their question. And you have to… you have to provide some standard templates for the way they communicate with GenAI. So… It helps you to, control the research environment, I think. Interviewer: Alright, thank you. Next question. Did… I think you mentioned already a couple, but maybe we can just recapture them. Did you encounter any ethical concerns, like over-reliance on AI, plagiarism, misuse of AI tools in 31269?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,82,"I haven't seen using any plagiarism tool, for, for the assignments. Maybe, maybe, Subject Coordinator-31269, received some reports, from the plagiarism tools, I'm not pretty sure. Yeah, using, using, plagiarism tools can be helpful, but, again, I have to mention that, plagiarism tools just can find an exact copy of content, not, not change or modified copy of the content. So, again, it is difficult, to understand, misuse of Gen AI or overuse of the GenAI. Yeah, actually, I do not have a very good idea how to control or monitor this behaviour. Interviewer: it's less about controlling, it's more about if you have seen it in your class, in your tutorials, that some students, they over-relied on genitive AI tools, or they misused AI tools or they plagiarize, they plagiarized through AI tools."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,83,"So, you know, my strategy is that when I feel that a student has used Gen AI to make sure about, to make sure about it, I asked some concepts about the course and about the task…a student is not able to respond to my question. I asked the students, just inspect it, I will… I will come to ask you again. Or I asked the group, I will come again and ask you some part of the questions, okay? So I force a student to understand the task, I force a student to try to interpret the answer. And for me, it doesn't matter if they are not able to respond to my question, at the first time. I see they have used Gen AI, they are negating that they have used any Gen AI tools, doesn't matter, but I asked the students to interpret your answer. If they are not able to answer, I will ask them…, yeah, I will go and ask the question again and try to interpret your answer. Tjis the way I can handle it inside the class. Interviewer: But you have seen in your class… in your class, you have seen cases of over-reliance and also misuse of GenAI, right?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,84,"Yep, yep. Interviewer: Okay. Next question. How effective were the current subject guidelines included in 301269, the scaffolding activities and the resources in promoting ethical and critical use of generative AI? We already talked about the template, but maybe also let's reflect on the other guidelines that exist in this subject. Do you think they were effective? And if so, why, or if they weren't effective, why not?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,85,"I have seen just some standard templates inside the website if you go to the Canvas, you will see, there is a link mentioning about the… sorry, about the using Gen AI and some ethics, some ethics guide on it. But I'm not, I'm not telling that it is effective, because, some students even…even do not review, this content. Just passive. So, for me, it is not effective at all. It is not effective at all. Interviewer: And the tutorial activities, the intervention activities in week 5, 8, and 11?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,86,"Yep. Not at all, not at all. You, you just, you just, give some hints to the students. But, the… the… Yeah, morally, they can follow it. But the behavior shows that, they have not… They have not, used these ethical guidelines in their task activities, you know? Yeah. So, it depends on the personality of the student. And, because, they are in pressure of time, because they are not able… sometimes they are in lack of time, so what is the best way? They try to use the Gen AI to provide the answer to the question and the content very quickly, so…why… If you see from the perspective of our students…from the Gen AI, you, you can, you can receive very quick answer to the question, so why not? And there is no mechanism to control their behaviour. It is just morally. And maybe they… they will follow these moral, ethics, or they will not. Interviewer: Do you have any enhancements in mind that you would recommend, maybe, to Subject Coordinator-31269 for the future curriculum design? How could we improve this for future offerings?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,87,It is very difficult. I don't have any comprehensive answer to this question.
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,88,"But, considering the task, If you explicitly ask the student, yeah, do this yourself…do it by genuine, compare them, and provide the links and information to me. To make sure that, you have used a standard template in using Gen AI. So, maybe, it can reduce, the misuse of the Gen AI. It is more under control. Interviewer: So you're saying it's probably better to focus on… avoiding the misuse of generative AI tools instead of focusing too much on showing how to perfectly use generative AI?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,89,"Yeah, yeah, it's better..In a standard way, in a standard way. Interviewer:What is the standard?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,90,"You can provide some standard Templates? I mean, prompt templates. And as they say, yeah, use this template, and just, compare the output of GenAI with yours and when, students are in short of time, so…they don't have enough time to challenge with GenAI, they have to provide the answer to this question very quickly. Interviewer: Great. Looking at the next question, I feel like you already answered it. The next question would have been, looking ahead, what improvements would you suggest for integrating generative AI tools more effectively into assessments and learning activities? So that's obviously part of the curriculum, and you were already mentioning how you imagine it to be, and I think we can take the same answer that you just gave to also answer this question."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,91,"Okay. Interviewer: Do you want to add anything, or do you agree with that?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,92,"No, I don't have a… yeah, as I told you, I don't have a comprehensive answer to the question for most of the course, not just BRM course, because this is this… there is a similar problem for all courses that a student use GenAI for. For BRM, the BRM is a little different from, for example, the programming course. In the programming course, even, in the class, when students copy and paste the code inside the canvas…the canvas automatically understands, yeah, this is the copy and paste. The student has not written the code manually, okay? Even in this case, a student's ask the GenAI, see the response of the GenAI, and try to type the scripts manually, not just copy and paste, you know? So, they're naughty, they are very smart, and I don't know how to… how we can… as a tutor, as a coordinator, as a lecturer, I'm not sure how we can make sure that a student understands the course, and they understand the content, even, I think, having… exams, is very helpful, because, a student should understand the content of the course, but I think, for example, for some courses with hundreds of students, again, it is very difficult to manage. Interviewer: All right, thank you. One more question before we're almost there. After this last question, I just need some observational data around those intervention activities in week 5, 8, and 11, but let's look first at the last question of the interview itself. Talking about it just now, what types of resources, support, or professional development would be most valuable to help you and other tutors to confidently teach in AI-integrated subjects in the future? which probably are most subjects in the future. But yeah, do you have anything in mind that would be really helpful for you in terms of resources, support, or even professional development? Because you're already quite deep into LLMs, so you have a good understanding of them. But maybe do you have some… some in mind?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,93,"You know, the… this is… this is a comment for me, I'm not fairly sure that this answer is very good, but, There is a possibility of providing, a specialized, Gen AI tools for each course. So…you know, if you… if you force a student, or constraint them to use these kinds of tools, for example, this is tools especially as for BRM course, And you provide you provide the task inside this… this… Software, for example…ask the students to use this software to answer to this question before answering, after answering to this question, use, these control Gen AI tools for the, task compared the output of the students and Gen AI tools automatically. So, all of them can be packaged together, for any specialized course. For any specific course, I mean. For example, we can do the same for programming, we can do the same for BRM course, we can do the same for a methodology course, anything. But, you provide the task. Ask the answer, go to this software, and provide your answer and then automatically, compare the output of GenAI with the answer. And, students can interact with this software in a controlled way, not open, and using any Gen AI, because most of the… there are several Gen AI that just give a student some fake information, the answers are not correct, but seems to be very good. You know? So, providing, the… to recap it, my recommendation is that providing some specialized Gen AI tools for each course. And the puts… The assessments, the assignments, everything inside this software and automatically compare the output of their students with the output of Gen AI after answering the question by their students, you know? So, students will be inside some guide rails in a controlled way…maybe it would be helpful. You know, nowadays, it is a common mistake… it is a common problem for most of the courses, so…I'm not able to provide a comprehensive answer to this question, but just recommend that. Yeah, let the students use the Gen AI, but control, how to use it. Because you are not able to stop them…everyone use Gen AI for different purposes, you know? And students, they are young, they are naughty, they are smart, and will use Gen AI, for sure. So it's better help them to use Gen AI in a more controlled way. Interviewer: It's a great idea, interesting approach, for sure. Which will probably also require some…better professional development of tutors, because they have to know a lot about those tools, I assume, to also be able to give the right guidance of how to control those tools for students. So maybe it would be also good for a university to offer for the teaching stuff, some more resources and some more teaching around those tools. Yes?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,94,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, 100%. Because this problem is also for the lecturers and for the, students. You know, nowadays, Gen AI is much more professional themselves. Sorry if I'm telling this in this way, but sometimes you see that the output of Gen AI is much better than the output of a lecture because it has access to more updates, information, or context, or books, on this on the internet. So, it is normal that the output of GenAI is much better than the output of a lecture. So, if… if you have a kind of software to provide Gen AI for each course in a more specialized way, specifically for this… for each course. So, the lecturers are also able to use this software, and also their students are able to use this software. Interviewer: Amazing. Thank you so much for this answer. We only have 5 minutes left, and I want to go real quick through the observational data from those 3 intervention activities. It's pretty basic prompts that I will give you now, but can you tell me a bit about the observed student enthusiasm when they were working on those intervention activities? So, how was the energy in the room when students worked on those intervention activities where they were supposed to use generative AI. Were they engaged, not so engaged, excited, not so excite? Your thoughts around this?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,95,"Yeah, actually, I found, this activity very exciting, for me and for student. Because I can see that, yeah, students are…I got as excited, when they see the output of Gen AI. You know? This is very good, because they can see that, yeah, there is a very good reference, of, experience when they use GenAI. And also the behavior of students when they try to change the prompt to get weak answer from Gen AI to show that their output is better than the GenAI is nice, you know? Because this, this kind of challenge between the students and GenAI is, is nice as well. Because they understand…this is, this is a very, very, good answer from Gen AI, even than better than this group activity. So, the output of this tool is better than the output of this group of students. So, it makes them… very excited… excited how it is possible, that GenAI will provide some very experienced answer to this question. So, yeah, this is good and bad, and I intrigue the students to attempt them to use Gen AI. Yeah, use it to see how it is useful, how it can help you but please do not provide the answer of GenAI as yours. This is a challenge. It will not finish, until you provide them a controlled way of using GenAI. Interviewer: Yeah, that's true. And when you observed students, most of the students, what kind of generative AI tools were they using? Was it mostly Copilot?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,96,"In the, in the course, if… if you are speaking about the BRM course, in the, in the tutorial are asked to use Copilot as a Gen AI tool because this is available from the UTS website. But, I didn't limit them to use Copilot, because some of them wanted to use, ChatGPT or Gemini…but most of them used Copilot, based on the recommendation inside the tutorial. Interviewer: And was the objective of each of those intervention activities clear to students? In week 5, 8, and 11, the objective of…using generative AI and the comparison was clear to students?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,97,"Yeah, for me, I had, I had a discussion, I repeated this several times to the students, that what is the objective of this task, because we would like to show you that, yeah, GenAI…how we can provide some information…but most of the time, the output from GenAI is very good, much better than the output of… even much better than the slides and lectures. You know? So this is the reason why I try to, give them some feedbacks about using the Gen AI, and even I showed… I showed them how to use GenAI to provide better answers. You know? But so what they provide at the end of the tutorial is different, because they try to make the output of Gen AI weaker. Interviewer: And that's probably one of the challenges that you encountered, but did you also saw a challenge related to, maybe, technical understanding of generative AI tools, or motivational…"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P04,SPR-P04,98,"No, because they are students from Faculty of Computer Science, I mean, their School of Computer Science, so they know, some concepts and details about the Gen AI, but maybe you will have different experience when you ask the students from other disciplines. Interviewer: Yeah. All right, thank you so much. We are now 59 minutes in. That's pretty much it. All the questions done. Thank you so much. 31269 Spring – Fifth Tutor Interview Interviewer: the recording. I hope it's okay that I record this session for data analysis purposes."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,99,"Yeah, all good. Interviewer: Beautiful. Interviewer: So maybe just as a quick introduction, this interview is here to reflect on your experience teaching in an AI-integrated subject, and we will explore your familiarity with GenAI tools and how they were used or observed during the semester. And your general thoughts on student engagement, ethical concerns and the support provided by UTS and other people within, UTS. And it's part of the first and further year experience grants, and as such, this study aims to better understand how students engage with AI-integrated assessments, and how they develop evaluative judgment skills for learning and reflections. And the ultimate goal is, based on the insights that we get out of this, study, to help shape future assessment strategies and curriculum improvements in BIS courses at UTS, similar to the one that you're tutoring this semester in 31269. And yeah, that's kind of, like, the broad overview."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,100,"Alright. Interviewer: Any questions before we start with, the interview?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,101,"No, I think it's all good, yeah, let's see how it goes. Interviewer: Okay, cool. Gonna be fine. Let me just get the first question and copy it into the chat. So… What was your level of familiarity with generative AI tools before teaching this subject?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,102,"I don't use that, like, the… I have experience of using this to, like, for, for my research purpose, I use that, not for teaching purpose, because usually students, they use it. So, for my research purpose, I use that. Not for modelling, but for, like, writing purpose, basically. Interviewer: And what specific tools are you using?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,103,"I basically used that, that Grammarly and, that, that another one was Quilt, called, Quilt Bot, thing, that, that was, QBolt, QBolt, I guess..That was… I used to use, but I never used ChatGPT for my, for my research purpose. Yeah, these two tools I usually used for… just for writing, like, you know, correcting the grammars and all those writing purposes, that's it. Interviewer: Okay, so how frequently do you use those, generative AI tools in your professional work for only research, you were saying?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,104,"that was for research, but no, I'm not doing research anymore. That's for my PhD, that was, mentioned, for writing purpose, basically. And for now, for teaching, sometimes I just, like, I use this tool for… for, like, formatting, some comments, or for, like, you know, just to…these days, I really don't use much, to be honest, yeah. Because the work I'm doing now is basically tutoring, so for this tutoring purpose, I really, just don't need to use any AI tool. Besides that like, teaching, like, we use that, Canvas, there are some Canvas integrated tools, that Subject Coordinator-31269 introduced, to us, like, to provide the feedback to students, with that voice and video. Those two I used, I tried to use, but I found it's a bit, like, you know, because you have to mark a lot of assignments…sometimes it's a bit time-consuming for me, instead of just putting… giving them comments, that's what, like, I used to do that. So, but I found that it's a bit, like, you know, time-consuming to do the videos and go through with that. Maybe if we do it for only a few submissions, or few assignments, that it might be, but, like, for me, I take a lot of classes, so I found that it's a bit time-consuming. Interviewer: Okay, and that's also a generative AI tool for the video recording?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,105,"That integrated tool, like, like, one is a speech, and another one is video. I tried that, speaking one, like, you speak, and then, it generates the…like, you know, the comments for you. Like, the same thing is translate… your voice and translate to the comments. Same thing, as a comment section for the students. That's what I used. I tried the video, but I found that these two are very time-consuming for me, just to be honest. So, I didn't, use that much. So Subject Coordinator-31269 asked… requested us, like, she showed us how to use these. As I just mentioned, like, I'm not following those. I… we just tried those, like, if we can use. But, as I just mentioned, I found those a bit time-consuming for me. I'm not used to it then, maybe that's why. So I'm just using, like, the general comments the way we used to do. Interviewer: And this tool is part of Canvas, or…"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,106,"Yes, Canvas is integrated tools. These two are integrated tools, part of Canvas. Interviewer: Okay. Then just to sum it up once more, so in general, you're not really using generative AI tools much, only some of them for wording and grammar purposes… you used to use them for research that you did during your PhD, and every now and then for tutorial preparations in regards to the content. You also review some of the grammar and wording through the mentioned generative AI tools, right?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,107,"Yes. Interviewer: Okay, so for administration and teaching itself, you don't really use generative AI tools?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,108,"Not really, because the subjects I'm teaching is very much, already well prepared by the coordinator, so it's not, like, I don't have much, like, input to prepare those things. Yeah, sometimes, I use, that, ChatGPT, not ChatGPT, I use mainly Google, Google, that's such that because I really don't really like that chat GPT, because I see it really brings up some weird stuff sometimes, which is not even relevant. So I just use the Google, just to cross-check that what I'm, like, thinking of, whether it is right or not, whether I'm on the right track or not, just for further reference. Interviewer: Okay, thank you. Next question. I'll just copy and paste it into the chat. Prior to this subject, had UTS provided you with any training, resources, or support on the ethical use of generative AI in education?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,109,"Not really. Interviewer: Okay, nothing that you can recall?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,110,"No, we had a, like, I attended some, like, training session, but that wasn't really based on this ethical use of generative AI. But last year, we had a… I can't remember that training session where, like, the… all the… all these teachers, I can recall, like, it was a big, like, huge, session for all the teachers. They were doing the presentation. I think Subject Coordinator-31269 also had her, like, this… this presentation, like, about this… using these generative AI tools in… in her subject, some research. They… the teachers, like, all the research going on, they had this presentation, how they are incorporating this generative AI. So this… that was not… that session was not only based on this generative AI, that was overall from the whole university, and the teachers had, like, some other resources, other research topic, so we could choose which session we want to use, we would like to go and see how it is using. So, from there, but it was a particular. I don't remember that I have used… I have, like, I have gone through with any specific training for tutors, like, to use it. Interviewer: It was more like a side, topic in this program for teaching staff, but it was not the main focus, right?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,111,"Yes, because that session was… that… that day was, for all the teachers, and they… they brought, like, they had the separate session for their research, showcase, so… and you could have choosen, I think Subject Coordinator-31269's one was also there. I can't remember whether this one was not. But, Subject Coordinator-31269 also had some, session, and some other teachers, like, other coordinator, I… I teach their subjects, I attended their session also. So they had, like, every…like, teachers, they had coordinators, they had different, different, like, research ground they used for their subject. But I remember that Mahera had one for this, using this AI tool in education. So that was, like, their showcase, they, they presented their research outcome, something like that, not a specific, training session. Interviewer: Okay. Thank you. What additional support or training… training would you like to see offered in the future, anything in mind?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,112,"Yes, I would like to… because it's always our concern that…. I would like to have session, training session, and that how we can really assess the student based on, like, because these days, I find that, like, you know, checking the assignments, and especially assignments, because during the tutorial, we can observe them, who is using what tools, but when they're working on the assignment, it's, like, it's their own time. So, it's really hard to check the assignment. It takes longer time than before, because you need to assess that whether it is really, like, you know, their own task, or, like, their AI tool generated. Because some very smart students, they, like, you know, they use this tool very smartly, but some other students, they don't know, or they just don't bother how to use it smartly. So it takes time to really assess that, like, whether it is their real, like, real task, or whether it is, like, you know, using the generative AI tools, because not always they provide the prompt and the details. They just said that no AI tool used…So, which is not right. So, yeah, I think it will be great if, like, you know, for the markers, basically, when we mark a task and assignment, if we get more insight into that, like, how we can really assess, and how we can really judge the students. How far they can go, because if we take it, like, they are not using it ethically, everyone will get zero. So… so I think that, yeah, that'll be… that'll be great if we can have some, like, you know session on that, like, how ethically they can use it or not. How far they can go, and as the assessor for us, also, like, how we… how critically we should also assess them, and how we can really approach that, whether it is, like, you know, done ethically orif it's not done ethically… how you can, approach them also… like, whether you should really consider this, like, you know, punish them, or, like, you know, to bring forward, because they're… if they are not following this ethical academic integrity, like, for that, they should be, like, you know, that should be acknowledged somehow, that they are not following the right academic integrity. Interviewer: And if I understood correctly, it would probably also save you a lot of time too, if you're, like, a bit more sure about how to handle those cases."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,113,"Exactly, exactly. Interviewer: Yeah, okay, great, thank you. I'm just going to paste the next question into the chat. So you already answered this question, if I remember correctly, but I still share it. How did you integrate generative AI into your teaching or assessment feedback during this subject? Anything that you want to add to this question, even though you already talked about it?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,114,"Yes, no, no, nothing, nothing new. I think I have described all these points already. Interviewer: So basically, you were saying that you don't use it much for feedback, but that Subject Coordinator-31269 recommended the teaching staff to use the Canvas built-in tools in regards to providing feedback through video and voice recording, right?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,115,"Exactly. Interviewer: Yeah. Okay. Then, next question. In your opinion, what were the most significant challenges in incorporating generative AI into your teaching or assessments? You were mentioning for the tools that Subject Coordinator-31269, recommended, it's quite time-consuming, if I understood correctly?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,116,"Yeah, because maybe I'm not used to with that, because we, like, you know, we have to mark… I have to… actually, I have to mark a lot of assignments, so, if it's, like, only few, then I could have, like, you know, used that one, or maybe if I get used to, but I think, like, it was a bit time-consuming for me. That's my personal opinion on that. I found it bit time-consuming, because, I have to go through with that video, and then, like, like, you know, record that part, and then upload it again. So, yeah, I thought it was a bit time-consuming, because you get very, like, short time to mark the submission, like, the weekly submission and assignment, so you just need to like, you know, use the time efficiently. Interviewer: And if I remember correctly, in regards to other, generative AI chatbots, like ChatGPT or Google Gemini, you don't use them because they're not accurate enough, I think you were mentioning?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,117,"For assessment? For assessment? Like, assess students? Interviewer: Yeah, into your teaching or assessments, yes."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,118,"Yeah, like, teaching, like, of course, like, we get some information from there for, like, preparing, preparing the tutorial, yeah, but not for assessment, like, we can't, like, use those tools. Those are not reliable. We can't use those tools for marking or assessment, because, and I think we… we are not also, like, you know, ethically, we are not using those tools, like our… our students' tasks over there to, like, you know…We can't just copy our student task and use those tools to check the assignment for us. I think it's not also, like, you know, reliable and also not ethical, like, we shouldn't do that. Yeah, so I don't… I don't use any tools for marking or assessment, but it's only for my preparation purpose. Yes, I use that for my preparation purpose, but not for, marking or assess student. Interviewer: Okay."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,119,"I believe these two are different, because my teaching like assessment is, like, I'm assessing students, what I understand from your question, that when I'm, marking, because we had this discussion with the other teacher that, like, whether we can use any tool, like, because, you know, there are some tools which, I think those are not free, but we can use those tools, like, where you put all themarking rubric and the task, and that tool will, do the marking for you, or can generate an assessment for that, based on that marking. They'll do the task for you. Yeah, so basically that, but we, like, we don't have that, that access. I never use that, because I don't have any access of those tools. I think those are not free. So, yeah, for the assessment purpose, no, I don't use any tool, but for my teaching preparation, yes, I use, of course, sometimes I use, for like, for my preparation. Interviewer: I think assessments here is also aiming for including it into assessment in that sense that students are supposed to critically reflect on their generative AI use for certain tasks or, assignments in the subject that you tutored."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,120,"Okay. Yes, yes, yes, and they… they're very happy to use, because the subject I'm teaching, the Subject Coordinator-31269 subject, it has, like, some tasks incorporated, so students, I see that they are very, like, you know, very comfortable with that, using that, that task. Say, we have two tasks. One is your original task, and the same task, you use a generative AI tool, and they are very happy to do that task, because, you know, it's doing it for them. So, all they need to do is providing the feedback or reflection, like, how good or bad is that one? So they are very comfortable doing that, because they are always… students are, I believe students are using that GenAI tool these days very frequently. All the time, I can see when they're working on the task in the tutor class, I can see that this GenAI tool is open always. So they're getting help with that one. So, which is fine, as long as they can provide correct reflection on their tasks. But not always, not every… as I mentioned earlier, that they are… not everyone, are smart enough to reflect those properly, or maybe they don't bother, like, they just provide it as their own task. And sometimes, like, I… I… I experienced one thing, in my… one of the assignments for that Subject Coordinator-31269, that, some… we use similar kind of assignment before, not the same one. Everyone brought up one scenario for this assignment solution, which, we never thought of, but few of the groups, few of the students' group, they are using the same scenario, then I… I understood that, like, they got this scenario from using the AI tool. Otherwise, like, you know, it is not relevant, but they are bringing it up and providing it as a solution, as part of the solution, though I never experienced that kind of solution before within that subject, for that… for that particular assignment. So then I realized that definitely the tool they are using may be a similar tool, and that AI tool is generating, that similar solution for them, and they're using it as a reference. So, like, I need… they need… I said, okay, if you think that it is that, then you need to convince me. I believe that it is… it shouldn't be part of that solution, but still, if you believe that it is part of the solution, you need to convince us. But they couldn't answer that part, because obviously, they are not, it's not their task, so they couldn't answer this part properly. That's… that's what I, like, I experienced that one from one of the assignments I'm taking for Subject Coordinator-31269. And, of course, sometimes, like, you know, they use these tools, but the smartest students, they rephrase it, using different tools, because there are paraphrasing tools, so they use those tools also for rephrasing it, for paraphrasing… like, as if, like, these two are different, but, it's hard to tell that. It's hard to catch them that it is same assignment, because they use this paraphrasing and everything, they change it around. Since I'm teaching that subject, and I have this experience, so I can easily say that, like, it is the same thing, but it's hard to catch them. You need to, if you want to, like, you know, if you make some comments on that, like, they are… it is similar tasks. Then, like, you know, you need to provide specific instruction that, okay, these are the similar, but they have paraphrased, it is similar, but it is not the same thing. Interviewer: And how could these challenges be better addressed in future offerings? What do you think?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,121,"Like, I think, we… because for this kind of, scenario, we need to discuss with them, because I had these kind of issues with, I think, 2 or 3 groups, so, as Subject Coordinator-31269 explained that, okay, have a discussion with them, let's see what they explain. So, if they come… can come up with, like, good resolution, or they have good answer, then, okay, then we'll see from there. But if they just address that, okay, ESV copied, then it should be… from there, it will be different, like, solution. So yeah, so I had to discuss with them, because, with our discussion with the student, we just can't give them zero, or just can't put them for like, you know, for academic integrity or something. So that's why, like, I mentioned in your previous question that, like, if we have some kind of guidelines or training on this kind of assessment, and how we should deal with that, and how we should reflect on this kind of, like, using this AI tool, that'll be great. Interviewer: So, clearer guidelines of what's the next step if you, as a tutor discover, okay, there might be some… something off in the way the student reflected on their own generative AI use."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,122,"Yes. Interviewer: Okay, great, thank you. I'm just gonna copy and paste the next question into the chat. In your observation as the tutor in 31269, did the use of generative AI tools influence student engagement, learning approaches, or assessment performances?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,123,"Yes, of course it influences, as I just mentioned, that when they have these, specific tasks, using that any generative AI tool. They are very, like, you know, confident, and they're very happy to work on that part. So what I have seen, that, like, they use that AI tool to generate the answer first, and then they use that one to produce their one. So it's other way around. So it shouldn't be. So they use that guidelines and AI tools generated one, and they use as a baseline to draw theirs one, or mostly, like, we have… that subject is basically that we have to do a lot of drawing and modelling, so they use those, guidelines to draw their own model. And these days, like, you can see that, using this, after we incorporated these tools…their, their assessment is better than before. Yeah, so, yeah, they're, like, they're producing, better modelling than before. So, I'm not sure how good or bad their, like, you know, what is their learning, ultimate learning outcome, whether they're really learning, because we don't have any final exam, that's what I think, like, they don't… we don't have any final exam, we… it's only the assessment base, so they can always have these tools in front of them, so they are using it, and they are like, you know, creating better model and diagram for the submission. But if they had to do the similar thing for a final exam, say, for example, the, like, traditional exam, like, they have to, like, you know, like, do those similar things in their final exam, then we could have really understood that whether they have really learned something from those, using those tools or not, because I, I believe that there is no way I can really understand that they are, like, you know, they are learning really, their learning is really improved or something like that, because we don't have final exam for that. Though they have some quiz, they attend those quiz, those are also online. So, I think that if we had some, like, you know, final exam where they can, like, you know, they can really reflect their learning and then we can say that, okay, they have, like, you know, that it has been improved, or they really learned something by using these tools. So my honest opinion is that since we don't have it, so I really can't say that. They are producing good diagram, good outcome, good documents, good submission, but I don't think it's a real, like, no reflection of their ultimate learning that it has been improved or not improved, I don't think so. Interviewer: Okay, thank you, that's a great insight. So you would say, in general, the student engagement is positive, you observed it as positive, and also you observed a change of learning approach, that they use generative AI first to then build their own solution around it. Interviewer: In terms of what 31269 offers in regards to assessment, it's an improvement, yes, but you think it's, not… you can't really evaluate if the learning outcome actually, improved for students, because there's no real feedback in the subject for that."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,124,"Yes. Interviewer: Okay, great, thank you. Next question, I'm just gonna copy the question into the chat. You already talked around some of it, so excuse me if you have to repeat yourself again. While marking, did you observe whether students were able to critically evaluate AI-generated content, or did they tend to rely on it without verification? What strategies did you use to help them develop evaluative judgment?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,125,"Not, not always they can, like, you know, evaluate the outcome. Like, they really can't reflect all the time, like, whether it is good or bad. So they just provide some basic, basic reflection on that. And, I, like, we tried to, like, it's sort of, like, part of our tutorial learning, like, providing, assessment tasks that, we asked them how you have, like, you know, what you have done. It wasn't real…or, like, right reflection. It could be better if you incorporate this, these, these things. So the reflection they provide using that tool is not always in the right format. They really can't, like, provide, or evaluate those outcomes properly. Very basic, very basic, in my… in one word, I can say that. They just provide very basic, like, you know, reflection on those outcome… it is, like, or those drawing or modelling they use, they created by using an AI tool. So, it says that, like, they are able to critically evaluate? No, no, they… they really can't evaluate it critically. They just provide, like, very generic or very basic reflection on those. Interviewer: Would you say that's for the majority of the class?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,126,"Yes, majority of the class. Interviewer: And what strategies did you maybe use to help them develop evaluative judgment in the course of those 12 weeks?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,127,"So we provide, like, guidelines that, okay, the way you have to reflect, like… we provide feedback, like, a written feedback for the submission, so it should be, like, and also we provide feedback, like, during the tutorial of that, like, the way you have reflect… provided the reflection, it wasn't right, or it was not enough, so you should do more critical, like, you know, analysis on those, outcomes. So, basically, you provide the written feedback on their, on their task. Interviewer: Okay, thank you. And what teaching strategies or interventions could maybe better support the development of students' critical evaluation skills in future offerings?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,128,"Since, I think, like, they… if they use those, like, you know. My understanding is they really… when they use these tools to generate any diagrams or models or whatever, because, because of this, online lecture, which I also find are not very effective for the students, because they… because we can't force them, obviously, it's not mandatory, and they are not high school kids anymore, so it's up to them. So they just show up to the class without any, like, prior knowledge of what they are going to learn today. So they just straight away jump into the task, and that's why they… they really don't know what they are doing. So, we need to, as a tutor, we need to provide them some guidelines that what you're going to do. So, based on this idea, because in this 2 hours time, we need to go through… we need to give them enough time to work on that, so we don't have enough time to brief them all the tasks they are going to do. They are supposed to know this content beforehand, before coming to the class. Studying the lecture, attending the lecture, so most of the students, they just, like, blank about this content they're going to work on today. So, like, starting… so you need to pro… starting from this content, what they are going to do, and how they're going to do it, and what they're going to do it, everything…it's not possible for them to cover in this 2 hours time. But if they had, like, you know, previous knowledge, or they have the idea about the content, then they could have done it properly. Because within that time, it's not, like, you know, because they don't have any idea what they're going to do in today's class. So they really, like, you know, within this time, they really can't critically evaluate, because they don't know what they're doing. So within that time, and as a tutor, we are just giving them brief, like, we provide them brief discussion that what they're going to do today, and how they're going to do it today. So with that brief discussion, it's not… I don't think that they… they get much idea about how they can critically evaluate this, this, generated content, AI-generated content, because they don't know it. So what's not in your mind, you can't see it. Interviewer: Okay, so you would say probably it needs a stronger connection, again, somehow, between students and the actual content as preparation before actually coming to tutorial classes."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,129,"Exactly, exactly. So, within that time, they… they can't do this… because very few students I can see that they can do it, because they attend the lecture, or even they… they know the content, like, what they are before. They didn't attend the lecture, but they… they have gone through the content, what they're going to do. So they can, like, they can evaluate. As I just mentioned, if you can't see it, if it's not in your mind. So they don't know what they're looking for. Like, to evaluate it critically, they need to know what, what is the, like, you know, whether it is good or bad, they don't know, because they don't know the content. Yeah. So that's the… that's the problem. I find it… I think it's for every… every tutor, and especially for this subject 31269, I can say. Interviewer: Yeah, I'm also a tutor, and I can definitely relate to that what you're saying, yeah."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,130,"Yes, because you need to know what I'm doing it, whether it's right or wrong. To evaluate it, you need to know whether, like, you know, what should be in there. Interviewer: I love the perspective. It's… it's a great point. Thank you, Israt."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,131,"No, okay, most welcome, my pleasure. Interviewer: Next question, I just put it in the chat again. To what extent were students aware of any ethical guidelines for using generative AI in their assessments?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,132,"We… we have a… we have a, like, you know, provided… we have provided, a standard guidelines for using, any AI tool in their assessment. It is integrated part, like, if you use it, even if you don't use it, you should, like, you know, you should acknowledge that. So, again, not everyone…they just don't acknowledge, and they just simply say that we didn't use it. And, I think as a first-year student, like, some of them, they really don't understand, so we… at the beginning, we… we provided them some, like, you know, like, you know guidelines that if you really don't follow these, you'll be really penalized, or, like, you know, you'll be, like, you need to face this academic integrity. So, since then, they are a bit aware of that, like, it happened with few, few groups. So, since then, they are a bit aware of that. Okay, they just kind of straight away copy and paste. At the beginning, they just straight away used to copy and paste without any acknowledgement. And even if you acknowledge it, you just can't use copy and paste. So, you need to modify it for your..You can use it as a guideline. So, I think, with due time, when they're, like, more familiar with the subject, after a few weeks, they… they now understand that, how, like, what's this ethical and to what, like, they can use this AI tool, and how they should, like, you know, use this acknowledgement for this. For anything they used to copy. They're, like, at the end of the semester, I can say that, okay, like, yes, they know. Interviewer: So during the course of the semester, they slowly understand."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,133,Yes. Interviewer: …are aware of the ethical guidelines.
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,134,Yes. Interviewer: Do you have any strategies in mind to maybe further improve their understanding or application of these guidelines?
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,135,"The one, because they don't follow instruction, hardly students, they don't follow instruction, only, only to, like, make them understand is, because we have some marks, dedicated marks for if they don't use this, guideline, or if they don't provide that acknowledgement, they just get zero for that part. So, if they get zero that is the only thing they can focus on, that, okay, we need to, we need to be, like, you know, up to that extent, we can go, and if we didn't do that, we didn't follow that acknowledgement part, so if I want to get better marks, I need to follow the guideline, otherwise I'll lose marks for that. Punishing them with less marks is the only guideline, I think, because they don't follow the instruction. That's my experience, from the subject, I can say. Interviewer: Yeah, okay, thank you. Next question. Did you encounter any ethical concerns? For example, over-reliance on AI, plagiarism, misuse of AI tools during the semester?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,136,"From the student, like, they did… yeah, at the beginning, they had, yeah, so we, we had discussion with them, like, since it was, like, the, like, the first one or two weeks, so, that was like, they just used to copy and paste, no acknowledgement or no changing or something. So we had a discussion with those groups, and we, like, I made them understand that it is not ethical, you can't do it. We are not punishing you at this moment, only… only…zero is up to this part, but if you don't follow this guideline, it will be… it will be taken as an academic integrity, and you need to face the consequence for that. So, yeah, so after that, I think they have learned the lesson, and they are following the guidelines how to use these. But, rather than that, or beside that, I didn't have any other concern, which is really, like, you know, we need to put them as a, like, punish them for academic integrity, or take it further for, any, like, formal assessment for that. I didn't have any issue in my class. Interviewer: Okay, great, thank you. Next question. Interviewer: How effective were the current subject guidelines and scaffolding activities, as well as resources in promoting ethical and critical use of generative AI? If you had to maybe rank it from a scale from 0 to 10?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,137,"The guideline is, I think…I can give it 8. But it's all about the students, whether they follow the instruction or not, because as I mentioned again, before that, they really don't follow the instruction, so the guidelines are there, like. All the… all the activities has been really structured well, and, like, you know, resources are there, so… but they need to follow. So I think, like, it's there, but they need to follow. I think it's well structured, and and you also, like, every class, in every class, we provide them guidelines that how ethically they should use any generative AI tool, so that they can get best out of it, but still, it's not, like, you know, they don't break that academic integrity, but they need to follow it. I think the guidelines and the, like, you know, it has been structured well. But we need to make some… I think we need to make some mechanism for them, like, so they really… I think it's for all subjects, they need to follow this guideline for every subject of any ethical issue for… but we just need to make sure that they follow the instruction. Interviewer: So do you maybe have, like, any enhancement in mind that you would recommend for future curriculum design of 31269?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,138,"I think, like, students, if they also have some kind of training about that, that'd be great. Like, it's a general, like, you know, general session for all students, like, they have to attend that session. It is about how they, ethically, they can use this, any AI tool for their study. I think that will be great also. Like, a mandatory general session for… every student. So, I think that will, like, they need… then they can't say that I didn't know, or, like, you know, they… at least they have this in their mind that, okay, I have… I have seen this, even I didn't read it for this specific subject, but in that session or from that session, I have learned that how ethically I can use these tools for any of my subjects, because it will be a general, like general, session. I think for students also, it would be great if we can provide a mandatory session for every student for the first year, yeah, for the first year student when they start university, because these are all first-year students who are doing this subject. Interviewer: Thank you. Next question. Looking ahead, what improvements would you suggest for integrating generative AI tools more effectively into assessments and learning activities?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,139,"the tool, like, we are using now, like, we can't… we don't have time, basically, for showing them, like, how, like, you know, how they can use those tools, and how critically they can, evaluate those tools, though Subject Coordinator-31269, like, you know, in the lectures she gone through with the task that… how you can assess that, like, whether it… you generate one diagram or model for one topic, and it has produced you some diagram, but how you can assess that one. She… she gone through with that task in the tutorial… in the lecture, but as I just mentioned, students, they just don't, like, you know, follow the lectures, so they end up doing the same mistakes in the tutorial class. Since students come to the class, in the tutorial class, if we have some time for that… for that section, like, how they can assess that diagram, or that produced one, what they have produced using that GenAI tool, and how they can assess that, I think that will help them to critically evaluate those outcomes. But because it's 2 hours time, we can't implement everything. But at least, like, every now and then, for maybe for critical tasks, or for critical activities, if we can also, allocate some time for that. Because I know Subject Coordinator-31269 gone through it in the lectures, the same task, how to assess those diagrams, but, even the same thing, because students most rely on the tutorial class, so if we can include those within the tutorial time, I think that will help a student to understand that… how they should assess those, outcomes. Interviewer: Okay, thank you. Interviewer: Next question, what types of resources, support, or professional development would be most valuable to help you as a tutor, teaching staff, and other tutors confidently teach in A-integrated subjects in the future?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,140,"I think I have mentioned that one, like, a, like, general training session for all the tutor. Interviewer: Yeah, anything else that's in your mind, except the general training session or professional development?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,141,"Not really, I can't think of any other resource, because I'm not, I'm not, like, a very, AI person using that tool very much. So if I would have used those, very frequently, then maybe I would have some idea about that. Sorry, I don't have, any other, any, yeah, any other particular thought of… about that, at this moment. Interviewer: All good. Thank you so much, Israt. Now we just have one last block for the interview that I want to go through, which is about the intervention activities that were happening in the tutorials week 5, 8, and 11. And I just want to maybe let you tell me a bit about the observed student, enthusiasm about those sessions. So what generative AI tools were used, for example?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,142,"Okay, they used, like, the Copilot one that we asked them to use, so mostly they use that Copilot one, because, I asked some students whether they use, the tools or not. So, they said that ChatGPT is not, not good enough to produce that kind of diagram, so it just provides some standard, like, you know, not, actual diagram. It provides some, like, you know, just, standard output as a text format, so they… they like to use this Copilot, which is, I think we also advise them to use the Copilot. And, they were, I think I also mentioned earlier that they are very, very interested about using those tools for the assessment, because then they have this, they have this, like, you know, outline that they're always… they're already using for that task in that… those particular week, and then they use those outline to form their original, diagram or model. Was that your question? Like, how do you use it? Interviewer: Beautiful. And was the objective of each intervention activity clear to them?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,143,"Yes, yes, like, they understood that, like, you need to assess, like, what they understood, I believe that they need to know how to critically evaluate, like, you just don't use one outcome from any tool, and then just don't use it. You need to assess those, or you need to evaluate those. So even they… they provide the diagram, but as I mentioned earlier, that they really hardly can provide a very critical evaluation of those outcomes. Interviewer: So, would you say that's probably one of the biggest challenges you encountered, or you saw, is that they really… maybe not struggled, but avoided a critical reflection, for those activities?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,144,"They… they don't want to avoid, they don't know how to do the critical evaluation of those tasks, because they don't know the content. Like, they really don't know what they're going to evaluate. They, like, they need to know whether it is right or wrong. So, to provide the correct evaluation for those outcomes, I need to know that whether this is a right one or wrong one. Then I can do the evaluation, what I'm looking for. So, they hardly provide very, very basic, very basic evolution for those outcomes. They can't do the critical one, because they don't know what they're looking for. Like, what is wrong with those outcomes? Because it is not right. And…those… those diagrams are basically, like, they… you draw those based on whatever information that AI tool has, but we provide them specific notation, specific guidelines that there could be very different diagram or different outcome, but this is what we teach you at UTS, and we want you to do a specific this one, this kind of diagram, or this kind of outcome we are expecting from you. So, whatever it generates over there, it is not maybe not the one we are teaching you. So, we want you to produce what we are teaching you. There could be some other, like hundreds of other different solutions. We are not interested about those, our main concern is you learn those… all these diagrams that AI tool is producing and compare that to the one we are teaching you, so that you know that whether it is right or wrong, and whether you are right… you're learning the right thing. Like, you have learned already that what we are teaching you, and based on that, you evaluate this diagram that… whether it is correct or wrong."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,145,"But what we are teaching you, they don't know that part, so they can't really reflect the same, for the… with the outcome. Interviewer: Understood. Okay, thank you, Israt. Last question, did you see any skill progression from week 5 to 8, from week 8 to 11, that occurred for students in regards to using those tools for the tasks?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,146,"Yes, they use those tools very, like, effectively. Of course, they're very happy too… because they use it for other subjects also. They use those tools very, like, happily and very, like, you know, they're very enthusiastic using those tools, but when it comes for the critical evaluation, that's the part they really, like, you know, they can't evaluate those properly, but…yeah. Interviewer: So they didn't progress in that sense, the reflection, but they progressed in utilizing it as a tool?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,147,"yes, yes, yes, utilizing those tools for improvement of the diagram, I can say, or the weekly submission. Interviewer: Okay, great. Amazing. Israt, that was quite long. Sorry for taking so much of your time."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,148,"No, no, no, that's all good. I learned from this, because I… now I can also… from this question, I also know… I learned some point that I should focus on this part when I'm tutoring, this… this subject, in the future, in… in upcoming semesters. So I'll focus on this point also. Like, it is also learning from me also, that, I'll specifically focus on this part that how they are working on this, these tasks, so that I can also provide them more feedback on those part. Amazing. Because I know this question. Interviewer: Yeah, and I'm happy to hear that it was also useful for you, that's cool."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P05,SPR-P05,149,"Yes, it is really helpful for me, to be honest. 31269 Spring – Sixth Tutor Interview Interviewer: This interview here is to reflect on your experience teaching in an AI-integrated subject, and we will explore your familiarity with generative AI tools, and how they were used… how they were used by students during the semester, and your thoughts around it. And, you also read the consent form, so you know that it's part of the FFYE grant that we applied for last year. And the aim is to understand better how students could engage, in AI-integrated assessments. And the ultimate goal is, based on this knowledge, we want to help to shape future assessment tasks, in this very new and exciting time of generative AI. So yeah, do you have any questions before we jump into the set of questions that I already provided you with."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,150,"All good. It's pretty clear. Yeah, we can start. Interviewer: I will also always just copy and paste the question that I'm asking into the chat, so you can just follow the text as well, so the first question… I'm just gonna chat. So, what was your level of familiarity with generative AI tools before teaching the subject?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,151,"Yes, because I'm a researcher as well here at UTS, so, yes, we were also as students also in the mode of exploration, but because I was teaching in parallel, multiple courses, so yes. I would say good. Not proficient, but good. Good level of familiarity, because off and on, we were told about these things into different talks, and we were trying to implement those things into our research as well. So, yes, good before… before teaching the course, yes, good level of familiarity. Interviewer: Nice. Any specific tools that you knew or used?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,152,"Well…it was like a buzzword when we were into, like, second or third year of research, so mostly it was ChatGPT, and then a few more integrated tools for literature review and analysis were used, but at that time, Copilot was not launched by UTS. So, because I'm done with my, PhD almost, like, final year is over, so yes, at that time, Copilot was not integrated into, like, how we see now. Yeah, so mostly it was ChatGPT. Interviewer: Okay. I'm just gonna get the next question ready. How frequently do you use GenAI tools in your professional work? Let's say teaching, administration, research?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,153,"Yes, so for research, as I've already mentioned, first couple of years were totally without generative AI.We used to have very traditional courses, and they used to, carry on all the tasks and assignments in a very traditional way, just like it used to be a couple of years back. Sometimes manual, online submissions, proper documentation, and all that… the classical way of teaching. So, yes, at that time, we didn't use, but in third year of research, there… I actually started use it… I personally started using GenAI for literature surveying, updating my literature review, which I've already done. And then, yes, in professional work, I started applying that. Not, not frequently, but off and on, I would say, for research. But in teaching, yes, for last couple of years, because I've been teaching this course fifth time, fifth, sixth time, so yeah, this was the first course which I taught with GenAI integration, since last two semesters. Other courses, they were not… they were not integrating GenAI into assignments, and evaluation, or studio-based learning, or tutorials. So, I won't say frequent, but yes, off and on, for research and administration, but yes, for teaching, now I'm using it frequently for, for, specifically for this subject, BRM. Interviewer: Do you have examples, like, how you use it?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,154,"Yes, because it is a design-based course, modelling, UML modelling, orientation, BPMN, business process modelling, notation, requirements gathering. So for that, the basics of notational language, or you can say the process of requirements engineering. So, there are certain topics in which students can think upon their own, but then they can ask generative AI to provide them, different design parts. So then upon… by doing reflection part, they can actually assess that what was told as rules and shared with them during the lecture, and is there any other smarter or, you can say, more generic pathway towards the design that they can adopt, and then improve their existing design? So, the way we are using it is, you can say, two-way, a reflection approach, and a refinement approach. So, in this way, we are, we are using generative AI right now. Interviewer: Okay, thank you. Next question. So, copy in the chat. Prior to this subject, had UTS provided you with any training, resources, or support on the ethical use of generative AI in education?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,155,"Well, that's, again, two-way. As I said to you already in the last two questions, I've shared the background, how it went for our, I would say, session, because I started in 2022. So, yes, I won't say formally, like, the announced, training sessions. No. We… I would say that we didn't attend any…or, in fact, they were not announced or, pre-planned sessions that we will be training, or UTS will be training the academics. But yes, off and on from library, and then when I was, from library, arranged talks, and then talks from different speakers, I attended. As far as the training resources or support is concerned, I think, two to three years consecutively, I attended teaching and learning forums, for which all the academics are usually invited. So there, yes, a lot of case studies, a lot of resources, support material, how different people are using Gen AI-based approaches, have started using GenAI-based approaches in a couple of studio-based courses. Yes, there I learned a lot. In terms of an ethical application, resources, how to explore, even as a tutor, what are the ways which I can adopt as a tutor to help students at least start exploring the help that can be taken from Gen AI. So yes, prior to this subject, yes, I won't say formal training, but yes, through talks, and through informal sharing of different, guided speakers, and then our teaching and learning forums. These were three, things that are coming to my mind, where UTS actually, kind of indirectly provided, support material. Interviewer: I think that's an important keyword, indirectly, because in the end, you were looking for…"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,156,"Yes, I don't think so, another appropriate word is coming to my mind right now, but I would say indirectly, because those were not… you know, when, as a firm, you say training session that is pre-planned, that has a specific agenda, you know what you are going for. But for learning forums, everyone is mutually sharing their experiences, because it was new at that time, right? Like, two to three years back, it was not been fully accepted into all of the courses, or fully accepted by all of the tutors. Even the universities were looking for proper regulation for this. So that's why, indirectly. Interviewer: Okay, thank you for clarification, nice. What additional support or training would you like to see offered in the future, maybe? Because now you were talking about the past."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,157,"Yes, I would say it can be more formal, because everyone nowadays, if we write our priorities when we are going to some, again, teaching and learning-based forum or sharing forum, so we'd say that Gen AI, at least me, myself, and other… a couple of other tutors who are, like, not very new, but at least 3 to 4 years of experience as an academic. So, I would say it should… it can be more formalized, and then, in… during the regulation process, by sharing our experiences with administration, who actually is a part of providing regulations, regulations for the use, and rules and regulations, and due ethical acknowledgement for AI, so they can take feedback from tutors, there can be feedback sessions, and then involving the… involving the main workforce, which is the casual academics as well as the, permanent academics. Then there can be a joint and mutual collaboration of the feedback and the lacking and the strengthening points that are coming from the students towards us. And yes, then we can, you can say we can reach up to a refined level of, discussions and documentation. So I'm looking for more formalized, approaches towards tutor training, and, yeah, tutor training, and I can say, might be introducing more familiarity towards the better use of AI. So, yeah, the sessions are there, but I might be… I have not seen, or you can say that, I can't witness something very formalized in terms of dedicated training in Gen AI for casual academics. Interviewer: Thank you. Next question…How did you integrate generative AI into your own teaching or assessment feedback during this subject?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,158,"Yes, so, as I've mentioned, this is a modeling-level course, requirements engineering, Business Process Modeling Notation. So, as per industry standards, we have different modeling notations standards, rules and regulations to model different systems. So, what we did was that, we have case studies on which students work, for this semester, one or two. So they have a mini project, and then they have a major project towards the end. Assessment 3 and 4 are two major assessments. So… and we have weekly tasks as well. So, across all these, assessments and tasks we picked out the areas where, GenAI can help them understand and apply BPMN in a better way. So, they can generate their own models, using whatever they have learned during the lecture, and what are the basics, or you can say the book or literature guidance, books-based or literature-based guidance, and then they can generate the same thing using, GenAI tools and then reflect, and then compare. So where were the strengths, where were the weaknesses? So, in terms of students' collaborations, they usually say, okay, it helped us to refine the model at certain areas, but it didn't give us that much straightaway answers in certain other areas. So for modeling, we are actually trying to, provide a reflection part on different kinds of models that students actually draw and learn for requirements engineering. So, yes, we have integrated that in a sense of, in a sense of refining the requirements and coming up with better designs for modeling UML. Interviewer: Okay, great. Thank you."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,159,"So that's actually a bit technical, because, you know, these… it varies from course to course, but all these are, the terms that I've used are course-based, so yes, PDMN and all. So, yep, will make sense for one who knows. Interviewer: Thank you. Next question. In your opinion, what were the most significant challenges in incorporating generative AI into your teaching or assessments?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,160,"Yes, so, I think the biggest challenge was when students start relying on, instead of exploring the rules and BPM annotations by themselves, they usually rely on whatever generative AI is doing for them. So, they usually… sometimes they take the reflection part, for granted. Like, it generates a model, so they start building up stories upon that, that it did… it did this, this, this, because of this requirement. So, I think over-reliance is one thing, and the second challenge was to, was the declaration part, where sometimes they use it, but they don't declare it. Some designs, by looking at them, the tutor can easily feel that this is over generalized, or might be a bit more professional that might be a student cannot come up with at this stage. So, yes, lack of, might be sometimes due to lack of, proper background knowledge. They try to use it, but don't declare it. So, the declaration part, ethically considering it, where you have utilized it, instead of fully generating the answers from… from Gen AI, like, instead of using it as a tutor, you're actually using it as a full-fledged solution generator, you can say. So yeah, so two things. The over-specialized, part of answers, where they are know that they are using it, but not declaring it. So, training them into ethical… ethically declaring it if they are using it. And, the other one was, again, the reflections part, where they actually tried to build up stories. So, I think sometimes two things, lack of knowledge, the background knowledge, in terms of how we can ethically use it, and number two instead of using it as a tutor, sometimes they over-rely on that. So, for me, these were the two challenges. Interviewer: Okay, thank you. And how could these challenges be better addressed, maybe, in future offerings?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,161,"Yes, so, definitely, as I mentioned, that, we… in assessment, we don't rely on, whatever they have generated, just as… just by giving a prompt and, pasting the answer. We have a proper reflection part designed for everything, every… for every task that they are doing on their own, and then might be taking help from, generative AI. So, in that reflection part, if they are coming up with logical connections between what was asked, what was done, and what was the actual requirement. So, it's very easy to trace where they have learned, and where there were violations, and where there were refinements. So, it's three-way. By violation, I mean that certain rules and regulations which might be… are not that much correctly answered by Gen AI, they already know, because they have studied it in the course, in the teaching material. The other part, sometimes yes. They are thinking on certain grounds, but GenAI come up with a couple of more better examples, and a couple of more entities, you can say. So they actually refine their own design. And the third part is comparison and reflection, where they build the structure that, okay, these things I have improved, and these things were basics. So, yes, we never rely on the exactly copy-pasted answers from Gen AI. There is a dedicated reflection part, which they attempt, and try to come up with refined answers in the end. Interviewer: Okay, great. Thank you. So, next question…In your observations, did the use of generative AI tools influence student engagement, learning approaches, or assessment performances?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,162,"Well, yes, because as I said, it has been a buzzword, but now, as the things are evolving, it is becoming prevalent over time, which means that, yes, even sometimes, if certain task is not are meant to be done both ways, by on your own, and then do it through Gen AI, so they are interested in doing. So, you know, just to have a comparison, and just to have, you know, sometimes a deep dive into how the things are moving. So, yes, definitely student engagement has improved. And this is my observation for the last couple of years, because I was teaching this course prior to Gen AI integration, and now with Gen AI integration. So I can compare student engagement has definitely improved, and learning approaches as well, because it is designed the way that they learn one approach, do it on their own, and then apply and do it using Gen AI, as I mentioned. And then, finally, the reflection. So both of, the first two, like, student engagement and learning approaches have definitely improved, but for assessment performance, I don't think it improved. I think it's still static, and that is due to the couple of factors I've already mentioned in the previous question. Over-reliance, and not knowing, or unknowingly, not declaring it ethically. So yes, for assessment performance, it will still take time. And I think, we believe that might be our students are smart, and they know things, and everyone is using it. This is the bottom line. Everywhere you hear, everyone is using it, so are we, but it's not the case. I think we need to guide our students better, and there can be exploration and training sessions for students as well, that how to use it as a peer instead of, you know, over-relying on that. So, for assessment performance, there's still a long way to go. Interviewer: Okay, thank you. Next question…While marking, did you observe whether students were able to critically evaluate AI-generated content, or did they tend to rely on it without verification? What strategies did you use to help them develop evaluative judgment?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,163,"Yes, I think it's pretty much covered in our previous questions, but I can, again, iterate. Yep, so while marking, yes, I have observed that, many groups, because it's a very, massive course, in a sense that it has, you know, a lot of tutorials, more than 20, and definitely a lot of tutors. Why that is important to say? Because there are a lot of groups, and different kind of students as well, who are part of certain groups. So, yes, I have observed overall, many groups were trying to apply that critically, and discussing with the tutor, with the peers, group members, coordinators, that, yes, these are the certain areas…we have critically evaluated that and have written our reflection, while certain other groups sometimes try to use that without verification. And I can say that this…the second group is particularly belong to those people who don't attend lectures, who don't listen to the basics. So, again, that over-reliance factor, and without verification, they sometimes try to copy-paste the answers. So I would say that both groups, both kinds of groups exist. And the strategies are, again, we can… we actually, stress them again and again during the lectures, that, the way we have provided samples in your templates and assessment, tasks…these are the ways in which you have to use and come up with the reflection part. So, comparison and reflection, and then refinement. So, there is a proper tabular approach that we are following, through which we are guiding them for evaluative judgment, but yes, I have observed both types of students. Interviewer: Thank you. Let's move on to the next question. To what extent were students aware of ethical guidelines for using generative AI in their assessments?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,164,"Yeah, so, if, as far as only BRM or this course is concerned that I've been teaching, you can say we made them aware. So, if they just try to use it as a peer, I would say, or it might be, just like in our time when we used to take help from seniors, although UTS also has UTS helps and many other forums, but now just by sitting at home, they try to use it like a senior or like a helper. So, yeah, I would say that very less number of students were aware, but we made them aware through, we have a proper Gen AI declaration section in our assessments, and we have provided 2 or 3 samples. So, sample one goes, like. Have you… have you used…Are you declaring the proper use of GenAI in this assignment, or you have not generated any content using GenAI, or would you like to declare it? So we have a proper sample-based section through which we are trying to make them aware of the ethical guidelines, that how to declare it, how to ethically consider that you have used it for evaluated judgment. So yes, I would say that students were not aware of, like, a very few students I have, seen who, who dare to mention clearly that, yes, I have used it, and used it ethically. Otherwise, you have to make them aware that this is the proper way of declaring it. Interviewer: Nice. Thank you. Even though you already mentioned a couple of them, maybe we can just reflect quickly on the next question as well. Did you encounter any ethical concerns over reliance you were mentioning already, but maybe also some plagiarism, misuse of AI tools, or what if they just state that they haven't used AI, and you clearly can tell that they have used AI in their assessments? One of your strategies, if this strategy doesn't work out."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,165,"Yes, definitely. So let's re-summarize that, because, over-reliance, I'll talk again, but regarding plagiarism and misuse, I would also like to say something. So, yes, ethical concerns, definitely over-reliance is there, as mentioned. And then plagiarism. So, sometimes, undergrad students, specifically the ones who have first to second semester, they don't even properly know what is plagiarism and then on top of AI plagiarism, right? So, first of all, I think it's our mutual responsibility. Again, I said that there can be sessions when they are switching from high school to university just on these things, like ethical considerations, AI use, plagiarism, and then AI plagiarism. So, yes, misuse is two of two kinds, intentional or unintentional. So for this one, I have seen unintentional misuse, because weekly, whenever I go to class, they said, okay, we couldn't understand the sample that you have provided that we have used it, or we have not used it. So just if for learning purposes, without reflection, have I used it? Do I have to declare it as well? So I usually regard that as unintentional misuse of AI tools. So for that, I think we have to create more awareness in students. And then definitely AI plagiarism, again, unintentional, because some of those… some of those students don't even know what is plagiarism. So how would they know what is AI plagiarism? So I think there can be, we can create… we can, together as a team, create more awareness in them. And, yeah, yeah, that's all. But I would say that in unintentional misuse of AI tools, yes, I have observed. And the best example was the same, excuse me, as I quoted before, that, they are generating the design from that. They know what they are doing, but they forget to cross-check what were certain rules of BPM and modeling notations, and all that. So for that, you have to remind them that, re-evaluate that as per the guidelines, because everything is not 100% integrated into generative AI right now, that it will create the most refined model for you. Might be that most refined version is not even required by the client. So, this is where the difference comes. Interviewer: Okay, and how could you, like, this subject, better address or prevent such issues in the future?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,166,"I think no subject can fully defend or prevent that in future. It depends on certain areas of… within a course. Like, every activity or every topic is… cannot be designed that way, that it is a source of, always a source of learning. So, every topic, or even every course is not like that, where generative AI is helpful. So, I would say that we have to reconsider those areas, particular courses, where we can, through assessments, through, more practical assessments, we can assert this thing that they could avoid misuse or over-reliance. And the best example I've already given, just case studies and where it can help you as a peer to refine the model. But initially, you have to impart those standards that students have already learned in a certain course, and then ask them to apply. So what I mean is that instead of allowing them full use of generative AI, we can use agentic approach. Agentic approaches, like agentic use of GenAI, where it will ask, prompt by prompt. It will interact with you, give you examples of refinement, but not fully generating a design in just one or two prompts. So now, I think agentic approach is becoming prevalent over the… over, I think, last few months, is what I am aware of, what I've explored. So we can also allow them to use generative AI in a semi-restricted more just as a peer or tutor, instead of the full access, instead of the full professional access, where they actually try to over-rely on these tools. Interviewer: But that's gonna be probably hard to trace as well, because."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,167,"Yes, definitely. Interviewer: You can use any tool, you can just go for it."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,168,"Yes, there are… there are very few, I would say, research papers that I find in that dimension, but yes, as the regulations are coming mature over the time, I think organizations are considering that as well. Because agents have now started popping up, as we all know. So, yes, on those terms. Might be, in future. Let's see. Interviewer: Next question, So now about the effectiveness. How effective were the current subject guidelines, scaffolding activities, and also resources in promoting ethical and critical use of generative AI?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,169,"Yes, they were effective, as I have mentioned. With every task, that had two parts, with and without generative AI, every assessment and weekly task had a reflection part. And then there were proper guidelines using at least 3 samples in tabular format, where there were different ways of using generative AI and declaring it ethically provided to the students. In the end of the… in the end of every weekly task. So what they used to do in their templates, they used to provide their own answers, and then the generative AI part, and then the reflection part, and finally, they used to select one of the samples. Like, out of three samples, they usually used to select one of the samples, where they can narrate how they have used it. And then, finally, ethically declaring that with references. So there was reference part, reflection part, declaration part, yes, so pretty much it was very well managed with all the, all the guidelines provided to the students, and the activities were, well aligned with the ethical considerations. Interviewer: Great. Do you see any more enhancements that could be made, maybe, to the next term?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,170,"Yes, because a lot of them are confused between these samples, so we are thinking to refine the samples a little bit more, because it moves like they have to provide, in the declaration part, they usually provide the prompt that they have given and the response produced."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,171,"So, I think we can refine it, further over the semesters, that they can provide just the sequence of prompts that they have provided instead of the final output they have produced, and then we can provide more clear samples of, which one they have used. Right now, it's just binary, not used or used. So we can… I think we can provide more, detailed samples to the students that how they have integrated GenAI into their assignments. And when I say more detailed, I mean might be using a short case study and a sequence of prompts, in which then they can also provide a replicate that, okay, this was a sequence of prompts that I have used. So right now, the samples are restricted, it's binary, either used or not used. Interviewer: Okay. Then next and second last question, let me just copy… Interviewer: But this one we covered, actually, looking ahead, what improvements would you suggest for integrating GenAI tools more effectively into assessment and learning activities? I feel like we covered this enough. Do you want to say anything else around it?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,172,"Yes, pretty much I have said, but improvements can be, across multiple dimensions. As I said, there can be, training sessions. And there can be more reflections on ethical considerations, and then I think, case study-based samples can be provided for ethical declaration. And then I think a little bit more awareness on this part can be provided, that there is, there is… there should be no intention of hiding it if you have used it, but be evaluative towards whatever the learning goal of that particular course is. So, yes, pretty much set, but I think these three dimensions, because no one knows what happens in future with respect to the agentic approach… agentic approaches that I've mentioned. Still, it's just research-based, obviously, not practical, and as UTS has launched Copilot already, so it has its own, future perspectives, testing power, and all. So yes, in that dimension, I think it's… it's for… it's on industry power or government regulations, but as far as directly a student-to-student or student-to-care academic interactions are concerned, yes, together we can impart these improvements by providing more detailed, sampling and talking for awareness on those terms, that, what is, AI plagiarism and plagiarism, what is the effective use of Gen AI, and how to declare it and ethically consider it using your evaluative judgments. So, yes, for that, we really need to work upon… a few might be, in start of every semester, we can discuss a case study as a tutor with them that how we are using it into research, what are the benefits, what are the disadvantages, and then let them shape up for their own assignments and weekly tasks. Interviewer: Great, thank you. Last but not least, the final question, what types of resources, support, or professional development would be most valuable to help you or other tutors at UTS to confidentially teach in AI-integrated subjects in future?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,173,"Yeah, so as I said, we also need, discussion forums, formally planned ones, announced ones. Like, I was keen to explore, this field, which I couldn't do in initial, couple of years of my research, so I actually explored it as a student as well as a tutor. So, but that was not, I would say formally announced or pre-planned as training sessions. So wherever I used to find a talk on that, I used to grab the opportunity and start exploration. So I think that these, as for the professional development staff, these things can be formalized in terms of training sessions, you can say, or talks. So, yeah, that… that… that would be good. And then, obviously, just like right now, we are conducting, surveys and interviewing, so feedback sharing, and response sharing can be more often, which could impart then a refined set of regulations that can eventually be applied and shared in our different learning courses. Interviewer: Nice. Interviewer: No, that's great. Thank you. Just one last space that I would like to explore is in regards to the intervention activities that you used for the weekly tutorials. So you used not only for your assignments, some sort of, like, AI guideline, or policies, or, samples, and…even, like, a template that you used for the submissions, if I understood it right, yes?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,174,"Yes, yes. Interviewer: But also in week 5, 8, and 11, there were intervention activities, aiming for using generative AI, and also reflecting, critically reflecting on the use of generative AI. I just wanted to understand, maybe a bit better, how did you, as a tutor, observe the enthusiasm of students during those 3 weeks as part of the intervention activities in class."
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,175,"Overall good. To some, some, as I said. I have observed two types of groups. Some really didn't want to use that, some really wanted to explore that, and then there is a third group who just want to make the task easier for themselves, without… without… without evaluation. So yes, overall, they were enthusiastic. If I have to rank on a scale of, like, like, on a scale… on a percentage of, which side there were more students, I would say more groups were enthusiastic. And there was a less number of students compared to those who were enthusiastic, who really didn't want… who just wanted to use it to ease down the task. And they feel that the job is done, but it becomes more complicated eventually. So yes, I've observed both types of students. Overall, they were enthusiastic, especially where there were intervention activities last couple of weeks, where the activities were, two folded, they really enjoyed that. And, like, on-spot feedback, we usually take, or, with every connected, task, with every connected weekly task when I go to the class, I used to give previous marked assignments feedback as well. So there, I have seen a lot of enthusiasm in students that we improved this way, across these couple of weeks. While the others, they were, like a few are who don't even want to use generative AI. Interviewer: So yes, both type of students exist right now, I would say. Interviewer: Okay, thank you, and the intervention activities, they were mostly clear in that case for the students, I assume, or…"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,176,"I think tutors always assume they are clear, but… but to students, they are not. So, yes, they used to ask me questions, again and again, sometimes on email, sometimes during the session, that we have read it. Have we understand it correctly? Can you please discuss that again? So, yes, overall clear, but yes, students are students, so yeah, they will ask. Interviewer: Yeah. And they were mostly using Copilot in those tutorials, or…"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,177,"Yes. A few I have seen, a few I have seen were using ChatGPT as well, but that were their own, purchased versions I think. But mostly, we encourage them to use only Copilot in the class. And proper documentation on the use of Copilot, and the links and everything is also provided as part of the template, where even if they are not aware of anything, they can still go to those links and study that, okay, this is the proper way of accessing and using Copilot. So I forgot to mention, and thanks for reminding, that's also mentioned in the template section, and in our Canvas, main documents as well, that how you can approach and says, using your UTS credentials. Interviewer: And, in regards to the intervention activities, were there any challenges that you encountered, except some students that didn't really understood?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,178,"Yeah, pretty much same, that, yeah, the way I've answered the previous questions, same challenges, pretty much, I think we have covered pretty much, the same challenges. As per their nature of adaptation, and also the nature of the activity that they are doing, overall good, I would say. On a scale of 70-30, I would say 70% of the students well taken, well understood, gave nice feedbacks. A few 30% were not interested. Interviewer: Nice, great. Do you have any last questions for me?"
tutor,31269,Spring,Third,tutor,SPR-P06,SPR-P06,179,"All good. I think it's just the audio recorded, and yeah, yeah, everything is done, and… Interviewer: I'm just gonna stop the recording there. Stop the recording."
