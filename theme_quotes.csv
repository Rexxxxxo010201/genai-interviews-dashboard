student,AUT-S02,mixed feelings about learning benefits,"it wasn't fully across the board, but like it was 85% across the board"
student,AUT-S02,mixed feelings about learning benefits,it's not a definite yes or no. It's just kind of like a…I don't know

student,SPR-S03,desire for clearer guidance on acceptable extent of AI use,can I get it to do my entire task?
student,SPR-S03,desire for clearer guidance on acceptable extent of AI use,"it's clear as to how you should use it, but it's not clear as to how much you should be using it."
student,SPR-S03,trust in AI for learning but not for final judgment,I think integrating it in the sense where you're using it as a fact-checker rather than a method to actually complete your work is really good.
student,SPR-S03,trust in AI for learning but not for final judgment,"going forward, it should only really be used As a comparative tool. And only after you've done the work"
student,SPR-S03,trust in AI for learning but not for final judgment,"even then, I wouldn't allow it to make the final judgment."

tutor,AUT-P02,student over-reliance,over-reliance is one very serious concern…
tutor,AUT-P02,student over-reliance,ChatGPT make a student week in their engagement
tutor,AUT-P02,assessment integrity,we will have some tools that check the text and will tell us how much is it generated by generative AI tool
tutor,AUT-P02,assessment integrity,we should ask them to mention everything about how they use generative for each assessment
tutor,AUT-P02,assessment integrity,maybe we should ask a students. And also we have a tool that check the assignments that if it's generated
tutor,AUT-P02,need for AI-use disclosure and transparency,I think we should ask them to mention everything about how they use generative for each assessment.
tutor,AUT-P02,need for AI-use disclosure and transparency,"we put something in our assessment, for example, a part or section that students, for example, acknowledge about the application of generative AI tools and explain how they use"
tutor,AUT-P02,need for AI-use disclosure and transparency,maybe we ask students for all assignments to mention the role of generative AI in their outputs and results.
tutor,AUT-P02,shift toward oral and process-focused assessment,"Yeah, oral activities also can be another solution that you can students ask the students to generate something and present in the class."
tutor,AUT-P02,shift toward oral and process-focused assessment,"Because of that, I try to ask for some verbal and oral presentations instead of, for example, writing something in the class."
tutor,AUT-P02,shift toward oral and process-focused assessment,"instead of, for example, submit submitting or uploading their final results…we can find also see the process they use to analyze this data."
tutor,AUT-P02,lack of institutional guidelines and training,I'm not sure if we have some guidelines for that
tutor,AUT-P02,lack of institutional guidelines and training,"there is no guideline that we can say. For example, if you read this guideline, you will take everything"
